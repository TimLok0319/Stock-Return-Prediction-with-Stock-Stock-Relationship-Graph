Capacity - 8,000 \nWhile cricket was first played on Hagley Park in 1867 and it hosted the inaugural first-class match in New Zealand in 1907, matches were held at the venue infrequently before they were moved to Lancaster Park in the inner-east of the city from 1930. \nLocal cricket officials, however, were forced to develop a new international venue after the Feb. 22, 2011 earthquake devastated much of central Christchurch, including Lancaster Park, although the construction of new stands was making it more rectangular and less suited for cricket matches anyway. \nThe ground on the vast green space of Hagley Park on the western edges of the central city was awarded the opening game of the 2015 World Cup before it had been given planning permission. \nThe 8,000-capacity venue hosted its first test match in December, 2014 when New Zealand played Sri Lanka - the first international cricket match involving the home side in the city since the earthquake. \nNew Zealand have won three of their four tests on the venue, with the only loss against Australia in 2016 where former captain Brendon McCullum belted the world’s fastest century in his final match before retiring from internationals.
