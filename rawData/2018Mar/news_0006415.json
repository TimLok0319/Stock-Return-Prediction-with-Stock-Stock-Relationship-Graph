The growth was driven by higher revenue per unique employer as well as an increase in the number of unique employers utilizing the Company's online services. Average revenue per unique employer increased 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with the same quarter in 2016 due to successful up-selling efforts that resulted in the purchase of multiple and/or higher value online products and services by customers. The number of unique employers increased 10.0% to 370,746 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 337,104 in the same quarter of the prior year due to new customer acquisition.\nOther human resource related revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 30.4% to RMB352.7 million (US$54.2 million) from RMB270.4 million in the same quarter in 2016. The increase was primarily due to greater usage and growth of seasonal campus recruitment, business process outsourcing, training and assessment services.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 30.1% to RMB633.0 million (US$97.3 million) from RMB486.6 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 73.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 70.8% in the same quarter in 2016 due to economies of scale and operating efficiency.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 14.1% to RMB315.7 million (US$48.5 million) from RMB276.8 million for the same quarter in 2016. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 17.9% to RMB239.6 million (US$36.8 million) from RMB203.3 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses, headcount additions and greater advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 3.5% to RMB76.1 million (US$11.7 million) from RMB73.6 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 51.3% to RMB317.3 million (US$48.8 million) from RMB209.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating margin, which is income from operations as a percentage of net revenues, was 36.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 30.5% for the same quarter in 2016. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating margin would have been 39.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 33.5% for the same quarter in 2016.\nThe Company recognized a gain from foreign currency translation of RMB7.7 million (US$1.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with RMB1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to the impact of the change in exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar on the Company's U.S. dollar cash deposits and U.S. dollar-denominated convertible senior notes issued in 2014.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a mark-to-market, non-cash loss of RMB4.8 million (US$0.7 million) associated with a change in fair value of convertible senior notes compared with a gain of RMB4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOther income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included local government financial subsidies of RMB11.5 million (US$1.8 million) compared with RMB9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income attributable to 51job for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB305.4 million (US$46.9 million) compared with RMB203.4 million for the same quarter in 2016. Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB4.42 (US$0.68) compared with RMB3.45 for the same quarter in 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, total share-based compensation expense was RMB21.1 million (US$3.2 million) compared with RMB20.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nExcluding share-based compensation expense, gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 48.4% to RMB323.4 million (US$49.7 million) compared with RMB217.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB5.01 (US$0.77) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with RMB3.61 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Unaudited Financial Results\nTotal revenues in 2017 were RMB2,881.2 million (US$442.8 million), an increase of 21.4% from RMB2,372.7 million in 2016.\nOnline recruitment services revenues in 2017 were RMB1,871.7 million (US$287.7 million), representing a 21.0% increase from RMB1,547.1 million in 2016. Unique employers using the Company's online recruitment services grew 12.7% to 519,257 in 2017 from 460,811 in 2016. An employer who purchases online services multiple times or in multiple quarters throughout the fiscal year is counted as one unique employer for the annual total. Although the pricing of like-for-like services was generally similar in 2016 and 2017, average revenue per unique employer increased 7.4% in 2017 primarily due to successful up-selling efforts that resulted in greater spending by customers.\nOther human resource related revenues in 2017 grew 22.3% to RMB1,009.5 million (US$155.2 million) from RMB825.6 million in 2016.\nIncome from operations in 2017 increased 42.3% to RMB870.8 million (US$133.8 million) from RMB611.8 million in 2016.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a mark-to-market, non-cash loss of RMB496.2 million (US$76.3 million) associated with a change in fair value of convertible senior notes compared with RMB69.4 million in 2016. The large non-cash loss in 2017 was a result of the significant increase in the price of the Company's American Depositary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 2017 and its corresponding effect on the fair value of the convertible senior notes.\nNet income attributable to 51job in 2017 was RMB371.9 million (US$57.2 million) compared with RMB566.0 million in 2016. Fully diluted earnings per share in 2017 were RMB6.08 (US$0.93) compared with RMB9.68 in 2016.\nExcluding share-based compensation expense, gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job in 2017 increased 31.8% to RMB950.3 million (US$146.1 million) from RMB721.2 million in 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB15.16 (US$2.33) in 2017 compared with RMB12.13 in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and short-term investments totaled RMB7,132.0 million (US$1,096.2 million) compared with RMB6,080.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on current market conditions and factoring in seasonality related to the late Chinese New Year holiday in 2018, the Company's total revenues target for the first quarter of 2018 is in the estimated range of RMB755 million to RMB785 million (US$116.0 million to US$120.7 million).\nGuidance for earnings per share is provided on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the future impact of certain items, such as gain/loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP items to expected reported GAAP earnings per share, without unreasonable efforts, due to the unknown effect and potential significance of such future impact and changes. Excluding share-based compensation expense, any gain or loss from foreign currency translation, and any mark-to-market gain or loss associated with a change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, the Company's non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the first quarter of 2018 is in the estimated range of RMB2.80 to RMB3.10 (US$0.43 to US$0.48) per share. The Company expects total share-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the estimated range of RMB23 million to RMB24 million (US$3.5 million to US$3.7 million).\nRecent Transaction\nIn September 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to become the majority shareholder in Lagou Information Limited (\"Lagou\"). The transaction was completed in December 2017, and the purchase price was US$118.9 million, funded by the Company's existing cash resources. Although Lagou has been consolidated into the Company's financial statements as of December 31, 2017, the acquisition date was just before year end, and therefore, there was immaterial contribution from Lagou to the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCurrency Convenience Translation\nFor the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of RMB6.5063 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate on December 29, 2017 in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company's management will hold a conference call at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 1, 2018 (9:00 a.m. Beijing / Hong Kong time zone on March 2, 2018) to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results, operating performance and business outlook. To dial in to the call, please use the following telephone numbers:\nUS: +1-888-346-8982\nInternational: +1-412-902-4272\nHong Kong: 800-905945\nChina: 4001-201203\nConference ID: 51job\nThe call will also be available live and on replay through 51job's investor relations website, http://ir.51job.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), 51job uses non-GAAP financial measures of income before income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to 51job and adjusted earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude share-based compensation expense, gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense and its related tax effect from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company's core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations and do not impact its cash earnings. The Company believes excluding gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect, from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation or mark-to-market gain/loss is not indicative of the Company's core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor impact the Company's cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP financial measures excluding share-based compensation expense, gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, are important in helping investors to understand the Company's current financial performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.\nAbout 51job\nFounded in 1998, 51job is a leading provider of integrated human resource services in China.
