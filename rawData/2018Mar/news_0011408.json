The decrease in our effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the $48.3 million tax benefit we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflecting the impact of tax legislation enacted in 2017.\nOur effective tax rate was 19.9% and 32.0% for the full year 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax is primarily attributable to the impact of tax legislation enacted in 2017 and the adoption of the new stock-based compensation guidance we prospectively adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires the recognition of the income tax awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. We recognized a $48.3 million and $26.7 million tax benefit related to the impact of tax legislation enacted in 2017 and the accounting change for stock-based compensation guidance for the full year 2017, respectively.\n4. What is the breakdown of costs related to the cybersecurity incident?\nDuring the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $26.5 million ($12.0 million, net of tax), and $114.0 million ($71.3 million, net of tax), respectively, for expenses related to the cybersecurity incident announced September 7, 2017.

These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in significant cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.\nVeda acquisition related amounts for transaction expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $11.4 million ($9.0 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts. $11.7 million related to transaction and integration costs in operating income, $0.3 million is recorded in other income, net and is the impact of foreign currency changes on the transaction structure.

Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nIncome tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $2.1 million and $26.7 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs in accordance with newly adopted guidance. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nAccrual for costs related to the cybersecurity incident - During the third quarter of 2017, we reported that we were the target of a cybersecurity incident. We recorded $26.5 million ($12.0 million, net of tax) during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $114.0 million ($71.3 million, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with the costs to investigate the cybersecurity incident, legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation and costs to deliver the free product offering made to all U.S. consumers. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nImpact of tax legislation enacted in 2017 - During the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of recent tax legislation, the company recorded one-time adjustments of $48.3 million for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets (liabilities), the deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, because a benefit of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nAccrual for certain legal claims - We recorded a charge of $6.5 million ($5.0 million, net of tax) related to an accrual for certain legal claims in the fourth quarter of 2016. Management believes excluding these charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2017, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nCharge related to the realignment of internal resources and other - We recorded a charge of $5.7 million ($3.7 million, net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2016. These charges were predominantly related to the realignment of our internal resources to support our strategic objectives and increase the integration of our global operations. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016, since a charge of such an amount for 2017 is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nAdjustments for uncertain tax positions - During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $8.3 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from the completion of examinations of historical tax returns. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, because a benefit of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-releases-fourth-quarter-results-300607030.html\nSOURCE Equifax Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.equifax.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-releases-fourth-quarter-results-300607030.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T00:47:09.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
