Pomeroy, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon. \"Coupled with the progress we have made on overall credit quality, we expect to see the benefits of our larger investment portfolio in future quarters.\"\nMr. Pomeroy continued, \"We continue to see a strong pipeline of new opportunities in a healthy venture lending environment, which should allow us to maintain our consistently high yielding investment portfolio with a strong emphasis on credit quality. Our investments in the Horizon platform in 2017, including additional origination and portfolio management professionals, should allow us to continue to capitalize on these new opportunities in 2018. In addition, we remain focused on providing our shareholders with the potential for upside from our warrants and equity positions.\"\nOperating Results\nTotal investment income was $6.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $7.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The year-over-year decrease in total investment income is primarily due to lower interest income on investments resulting from the smaller average size of the loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, total investment income was $25.8 million and $33.0 million, respectively.\nThe Company's dollar-weighted annualized portfolio yield on average loans for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 14.1% and 14.2%, respectively. The Company's dollar-weighted average portfolio yield on loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 15.1% and 14.9%, respectively.\nThe Company calculates the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments is higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect expenses or any sales load paid by investors.\nTotal net expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $3.8 million, as compared to $3.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense increased year-over-year primarily due to an increase in average borrowings. Base management fee decreased year-over-year primarily due to a decrease in the average size of the investment portfolio. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, incentive fee expense, net of waiver, was $0.5 million. There was no incentive fee expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under the Investment Management Agreement, which resulted in $0.8 million of reduced expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Total net expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $2.5 million to $13.5 million, as compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.4 million, or $0.21 per share, as compared to $3.8 million, or $0.33 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net investment income was $12.3 million, or $1.07 per share, and $17.1 million, or $1.48 per share, respectively.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the net realized loss on investments was $10.1 million, or $0.88 per share, as compared to net realized loss on investments of $4.9 million, or $0.43 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the net realized loss on investments was $21.2 million, or $1.84 per share, and $7.8 million, or $0.67 per share, respectively.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the net unrealized appreciation on investments was $10.2 million, or $0.88 per share, as compared to net unrealized appreciation on investments of $0.5 million, or $0.05 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $18.5 million, or $1.60 per share, as compared to net unrealized depreciation on investments of $14.2 million, or $1.24 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPortfolio Summary and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt portfolio consisted of 33 secured loans with an aggregate fair value of $203.8 million. In addition, the Company's total warrant, equity and other investments in 82 portfolio companies had an aggregate fair value of $18.3 million as of December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, there was one debt investment with an internal credit rating of 1, with a cost of $3.0 million and a fair value of $2.9 million.
