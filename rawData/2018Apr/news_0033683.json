In our tower business, we have recently signed comprehensive leasing agreements with several of our largest customers, which we believe signals the beginning of a sustained period of infrastructure investments by our customers. In our fiber business, the volume of small cell bookings in the first quarter was comparable to what we booked during all of 2016, resulting in an increase in our contracted pipeline to more than 30,000 nodes. We also continue to make very good progress on integrating our recent fiber acquisitions. We believe our unique value proposition as a shared communications infrastructure provider will allow us to translate the growing demand for data into growth in cash flows and, thus, deliver on our 7% to 8% annual growth target in dividends per share.\"\nRESULTS FOR THE QUARTER\nThe table below sets forth select financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

Site rental revenues grew approximately 35%, or $296 million, from first quarter 2017 to first quarter 2018, inclusive of approximately $47 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues plus $234 million in contributions from acquisitions and other items, plus a $15 million increase in straight-lined revenues. The $47 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 5.5% growth, comprised of approximately 8% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 2.5% from tenant non-renewals. Site rental revenues for first quarter 2018 benefited by approximately $12 million from a long-term agreement signed with AT&T (\"AT&T Agreement\") that includes contracted new leasing activity across towers and small cells. Net income. Net income for first quarter 2018 was $114 million and was impacted by approximately $71 million of losses on the retirement of long-term obligations. Adjusted EBITDA. When compared to the prior first quarter 2018 Outlook, Adjusted EBITDA benefited by approximately $12 million from the AT&T Agreement. AFFO. When compared to the prior first quarter 2018 Outlook, AFFO for first quarter 2018 benefited from approximately $11 million of lower sustaining capital expenditures due to timing as those expenditures are expected to occur later in 2018. Capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $370 million, comprised of approximately $14 million of land purchases, approximately $22 million of sustaining capital expenditures, approximately $328 million of revenue generating capital expenditures and approximately $6 million of integration capital expenditures. Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of $1.05 per common share, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period a year ago. Financing activities. Crown Castle issued $1.75 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in January and sold 7.765 million shares of its common stock in March (\"March Equity Offering\"), resulting in additional gross proceeds of approximately $850 million. Net proceeds from both transactions were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing indebtedness. Overall Results. Adjusted for the benefit associated with the AT&T Agreement and the timing of the sustaining capital expenditures, first quarter 2018 results exceeded the midpoint of the prior first quarter 2018 Outlook for site rental revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.\n\"We believe we remain on track to deliver another year of solid growth in 2018 following another quarter of great execution by our team,\" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. \"We are excited about the opportunity we see to generate compelling total returns for our shareholders in the near to medium term through a combination of dividends and growth, while at the same time making significant investments in our business that we believe will generate attractive returns longer term and support future growth in dividends per share.\"\nOUTLOOK\nThis Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nThe following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for second quarter 2018 and full year 2018:\n(in millions) Second Quarter 2018 Full Year 2018 Site rental revenues $1,153 to $ 1,163 $4,639 to $ 4,684 Site rental cost of operations (a) $348 to $ 358 $1,375 to $ 1,420 Net income (loss) $139 to $ 164 $589 to $ 669 Adjusted EBITDA (b) $757 to $ 767 $3,097 to $ 3,142 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs (c) $154 to $ 164 $616 to $ 661 FFO (b)(d) $496 to $ 506 $2,002 to $ 2,047 AFFO (b)(d) $539 to $ 549 $2,255 to $ 2,300 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted (e) 416 415 Exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion. See reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss) and definition included herein. See reconciliation of \"components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" herein for a discussion of non-cash interest expense. Attributable to CCIC common stockholders. The assumption for second quarter 2018 and full year 2018 diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding is based on the diluted common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018. For all periods presented, the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding does not include any assumed conversion of preferred stock in the share count.\nCompared to the first quarter 2018, the midpoint of second quarter 2018 Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO are expected to be impacted by certain seasonal or timing items, including approximately $6 million of higher repair and maintenance expenses, $6 million of higher sustaining capital expenditures and $11 million of higher cash tax payments.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nThe table below compares the results for full year 2017, midpoint of the current full year 2018 Outlook and the midpoint of the previously provided full year 2018 Outlook for select metrics.\nMidpoint of FY 2018 Outlook to FY 2017 Actual Comparison (in millions) Current\nFull Year\n2018 Outlook Full Year\n2017 Actual $ Change % Change Previous\nFull Year\n2018 Outlook (d) Current\nCompared\nto Previous Outlook Site rental revenues $4,662 $3,669 +$993 +27 % $4,605 +$57 Net income (loss) $629 $445 +$184 +41 % $551 +$78 Adjusted EBITDA (a) $3,120 $2,482 +$638 +26 % $3,072 +$48 AFFO (a)(b) $2,278 $1,860 +$418 +22 % $2,242 +$36 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted (c) 415 383 +32 +8 % 408 +7 See reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss) and definition included herein. Attributable to CCIC common stockholders. The assumption for full year 2018 diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding is based on diluted common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018. For all periods presented, the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding does not include any assumed conversion of preferred stock in the share count. As issued on January 24, 2018.\nThe increases in full year 2018 Outlook primarily reflect the expected impact of the recently signed customer agreements and the March Equity Offering, as well as lower expected cash taxes, partially offset by higher anticipated expenses and an increase in expected floating interest rates when compared to the rates assumed in the prior Outlook. The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in site rental revenues from 2017 to 2018 of $970 million to $1,015 million, inclusive of expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues during 2018 of $185 million to $225 million.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/3107506c-a479-428a-97a1-de43e1cf2a6d\nFor the above chart, the entire expected contribution to full year 2018 Outlook for growth in site rental revenues from Lightower is included within acquisitions.\nThe chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in AFFO from 2017 to 2018 of $395 million to $435 million.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/21ac09f3-7d6e-4913-bcc9-fde1dc196da1\nWhen compared to the previous full year 2018 Outlook, the increase in expected growth in AFFO primarily reflects the March Equity Offering and lower expected cash taxes, partially offset by higher anticipated expenses and an increase in expected floating interest rates when compared to the rates assumed in the prior Outlook.

For more information on Crown Castle, please visit www.crowncastle.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations\nThis press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), Funds from Operations (\"FFO\") and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\")).\nOur measures of Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, FFO and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Network Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments for purposes of making decisions about allocating capital and assessing performance. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures.\nAdjusted EBITDA, AFFO, FFO and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\nAFFO is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.\nFFO is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.\nOrganic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and customer non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.\nWe define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures (i.e., sustaining capital expenditures).\nFunds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends, and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders.\nOrganic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of customer contracts.\nSegment Measures\nSegment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations.\nSegment Network Services and Other Gross Margin . We define Segment Network Services and Other Gross Margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated network services and other cost of operations.\nSegment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment network services and other gross margin, less general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.\nOther Calculations\nDiscretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They consist of expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure, construction of new communications infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers.\nSustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to either (1) corporate capital expenditures or (2) capital improvement capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure.\nIntegration capital expenditures . We define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made specifically with respect to recent acquisitions that are essential to integrating acquired companies into our business.\nThe tables set forth below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding. The Company has changed its presentation to millions and, as a result, any necessary rounding adjustments have been made to prior year disclosed amounts.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures:\nReconciliation of Historical Adjusted EBITDA: For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve\nMonths Ended March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 (in millions) Net income (loss) $ 114 $ 119 $ 445 Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss): Asset write-down charges 3 1 17 Acquisition and integration costs 6 6 61 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 374 289 1,242 Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments 5 5 20 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs (a) 160 134 591 (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations 71 4 4 Interest income (1 ) — (19 ) Other (income) expense 1 (6 ) (1 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes 4 4 26 Stock-based compensation expense 26 25 96 Adjusted EBITDA (b)(c) $ 763 $ 581 $ 2,482 See the reconciliation of \"components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" herein for a discussion of non-cash interest expense.\nSee \" Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations \" herein for a discussion of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe above reconciliation excludes line items included in our definition which are not applicable for the periods shown.\nReconciliation of Current Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA: Q2 2018 Full Year 2018 (in millions) Outlook Outlook Net income (loss) $139 to $164 $589 to $669 Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss): Asset write-down charges $9 to $11 $28 to $38 Acquisition and integration costs $13 to $17 $45 to $55 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $373 to $393 $1,517 to $1,552 Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments $4 to $6 $19 to $21 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs (a) $154 to $164 $616 to $661 (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations $0 to $0 $71 to $71 Interest income $(1) to $1 $(3) to $1 Other (income) expense $(1) to $3 $3 to $5 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $8 to $12 $28 to $36 Stock-based compensation expense $26 to $30 $104 to $112 Adjusted EBITDA (b)(c) $ 757 to $ 767 $ 3,097 to $ 3,142 See the reconciliation of \"components of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" herein for a discussion of non-cash interest expense.\nSee \" Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations \" herein for a discussion of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe above reconciliation excludes line items included in our definition which are not applicable for the periods shown.\nReconciliation of Historical FFO and AFFO: For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve\nMonths Ended (in millions) March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 Net income (loss) $ 114 $ 119 $ 445 Real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion 359 281 1,211 Asset write-down charges 3 1 17 Dividends on preferred stock (28 ) — (30 ) FFO (a)(b)(c)(d)(e) $ 447 $ 401 $ 1,643 FFO (from above) $ 447 $ 401 $ 1,643 Adjustments to increase (decrease) FFO: Straight-lined revenue (16 ) (1 ) — Straight-lined expense 23 23 93 Stock-based compensation expense 26 25 96 Non-cash portion of tax provision 4 4 9 Non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion 15 8 31 Amortization of non-cash interest expense 2 2 9 Other (income) expense 1 (6 ) (2 ) (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations 71 4 4 Acquisition and integration costs 6 6 61 Capital improvement capital expenditures (13 ) (7 ) (41 ) Corporate capital expenditures (9 ) (9 ) (44 ) AFFO (a)(b)(c)(d)(e) $ 558 $ 450 $ 1,860 See \" Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations \" herein for a discussion of our definitions of FFO and AFFO.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations. Such statements include our Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, returns, opportunities and customer and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, including on a long-and short-term basis, (2) our strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength of our business, (3) our customers' investments and the demand from our customers, and the benefits which may be derived therefrom, (4) growth in demand for data and the benefits which may be derived therefrom, (5) our growth, including our revenue growth, long-term prospects and the trends impacting our business, (6) the impact of and the benefits and contributions that may be derived from the recent execution of leasing agreements with our customers, including the AT&T Agreement, (7) integration of our recent acquisitions, including Lightower, the progress thereof and the potential benefits and contributions which may be derived therefrom, including the contribution to or impact on our financial or operating results, including site rental revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, (8) anticipated impact of the March Equity Offering, (9) leasing environment and activity, (10) our investments in our business and communications infrastructure assets and the potential growth, returns and benefits therefrom, (11) our dividends and our dividend growth rate and targets, (12) strategic position of and demand for our communications infrastructure (including fiber solutions and small cells) and services, (13) cash flows, (14) tenant non-renewals, including the impact thereof, (15) capital expenditures, including sustaining capital expenditures, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) site rental revenues and estimated growth thereof, (18) site rental cost of operations, (19) net income (loss), (20) Adjusted EBITDA, including the impact thereon of seasonal and timing items, (21) expenses, including interest expense and repair and maintenance expenses, and amortization of deferred financing costs, (22) cash tax payments, (23) floating interest rates, (24) FFO, (25) AFFO (including the impact thereon of seasonal and timing items) and estimated growth thereof, (26) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, (27) our weighted-average common shares outstanding, including on a diluted basis, (28) network services contribution and (29) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions prevailing market conditions and the following:\nOur business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for tenant additions and network services).\nA substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and network services.\nThe expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. Additionally, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Lightower acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the fiber business model contains certain differences from our towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated.\nFailure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business. Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts. New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues. If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber solutions, our business may be adversely affected. Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results. New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected. If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business. If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues. Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. We may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation. Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations. Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash. If we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives. REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.\nShould one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. As used in this release, the term \"including,\" and any variation thereof, means \"including without limitation.\"\nCROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (UNAUDITED)\n(Amounts in millions, except par values) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 220 $ 314 Restricted cash 120 121 Receivables, net 402 398 Prepaid expenses 175 162 Other current assets 157 139 Total current assets 1,074 1,134 Deferred site rental receivables 1,304 1,300 Property and equipment, net 13,051 12,933 Goodwill 10,075 10,021 Other intangible assets, net 5,854 5,962 Long-term prepaid rent and other assets, net 892 879 Total assets $ 32,250 $ 32,229 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 248 $ 249 Accrued interest 104 132 Deferred revenues 465 457 Other accrued liabilities 240 339 Current maturities of debt and other obligations 130 115 Total current liabilities 1,187 1,292 Debt and other long-term obligations 15,616 16,044 Other long-term liabilities 2,615 2,554 Total liabilities 19,418 19,890 Commitments and contingencies CCIC stockholders' equity: Common stock, $0.01 par value;
