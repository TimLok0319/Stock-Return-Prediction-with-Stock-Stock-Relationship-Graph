In addition, we are expanding our addressable markets into interventional oncology with the acquisition of Sirtex, expected to close by the end of May.\"\nThe company ended the quarter with $740 million in cash and cash equivalents and $255 million of debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $66 million. During the quarter, the company invested $36 million to repurchase 325,000 shares of common stock.\nOncology Systems Segment\nIn the fiscal second quarter, Oncology revenues totaled $698 million, up 10 percent in dollars and 6 percent in constant currency. Gross orders were $664 million, up 5 percent in dollars and 1 percent in constant currency. Gross orders in the Americas increased 2 percent in dollars and in constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders rose 11 percent in dollars and were flat in constant currency; in APAC, gross orders increased 3 percent in dollars and 1 percent in constant currency. Operating earnings for the segment increased 16 percent.\nParticle Therapy Segment\nIn the fiscal second quarter, Particle Therapy revenues totaled $32 million, up 2 percent. The company did not book any new ProBeam™ orders in the quarter.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses and Impairment Charges in Q2\nVarian's GAAP net earnings include acquisition-related expenses totaling $20 million for the quarter, primarily driven by $16 million related to hedging the Australian dollar purchase price of the Sirtex acquisition, as well as an impairment charge of $11 million related to the expected refinancing of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center in Baltimore. These costs and the associated tax effects reduced Varian earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.26 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and were excluded from non-GAAP results.\nFY18 Annual Guidance Updated\nConsidering the financial and operational performance in the first half and the impact of currency, fiscal year 2018 guidance is updated to the following:\nRevenue growth range of 6 percent to 9 percent, which now includes the impact from currency for the remainder of the year Non-GAAP Operating earnings as a percentage of revenues range of 18 percent to 19 percent Non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20 percent Weighted average diluted shares of 93 million Non-GAAP Earnings per diluted share range of $4.43 to $4.53 Cash flow from operations range of $475 million to $550 million\nThis updated guidance does not reflect the impact of the Sirtex acquisition, which is expected to close at the end of May.\nPlease refer to \"Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a description of items excluded from expected non-GAAP earnings.\nInvestor Conference Call\nVarian Medical Systems is scheduled to conduct its second quarter fiscal year 2018 conference call at 2 p.m. PT today.

We define non-GAAP operating earnings from continuing operations as operating earnings from continuing operations excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, legal costs, impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses and benefits. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. We have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis due to the potential significant variability and limited visibility of the excluded items discussed below.\nWe utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures to be helpful in assessing the performance of the ongoing operation of our business. We believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. We also believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP net earnings exclude the following items, except for significant effects of tax legislation, which are only excluded from non-GAAP net earnings:\nAmortization of intangible assets: We do not acquire businesses and assets on a predictable cycle. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition or purchase. We believe that excluding amortization of intangible assets allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our operations, and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies.\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses and benefits: We incur expenses or benefits with respect to certain items associated with our acquisitions, such as transaction costs, hedging gains and losses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, gain or expense on settlement of pre-existing relationships, integration costs etc. We exclude such expenses or benefits as they are related to acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of our on-going business.\nRestructuring and impairment charges: We incur restructuring and impairment charges that result from events, which arise from unforeseen circumstances and/or often occur outside of the ordinary course of our on-going business. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financials, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods.\nSignificant effects of tax legislation: We may incur significant effects of tax legislation that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity in the period in which the effects of such legislation are reported. We exclude such expenses because we believe this does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations. This exclusion is applicable to non-GAAP net earnings only.\nSignificant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs: We may incur charges or benefits as well as legal costs from time to time related to litigation and other contingencies. We exclude these charges or benefits, when significant, as well as legal costs associated with significant legal matters, because we do not believe they are reflective of on-going business and operating results.\nWe apply our GAAP consolidated effective tax rate to our non-GAAP financial measures, other than when the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment.\nFrom time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Non-GAAP items are generally included in selling, general and administrative expenses, except for significant effects of tax legislation and unless otherwise specified.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for Varian's continuing operations:\nVarian Medical Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation between Preliminary GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nQ2 2018\nQ2 2017\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nNon-GAAP adjustments\nAmortization of intangible assets (1)\n$\n3.5\n$\n2.8\n$\n6.6\n$\n5.6\nRestructuring charges\n—\n2.4\n—\n6.0\nLegal costs\n—\n10.0\n—\n16.2\nImpairment charges\n11.1\n—\n11.1\n38.3\nAcquisition-related expenses (2)\n19.7\n0.6\n21.2\n0.9\nOther\n0.1\n—\n0.1\n—\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments to operating earnings\n34.4\n15.8\n39.0\n67.0\nTax effects of non-GAAP adjustments\n(7.1)\n(0.8)\n(8.1)\n(12.1)\nSignificant effects of tax legislation (3)\n6.2\n—\n213.3\n—\nTotal net earnings from continuing operations impact from non-GAAP adjustments\n$\n33.5\n$\n15.0\n$\n244.2\n$\n54.9\nOperating earnings reconciliation\nGAAP operating earnings from continuing operations\n$\n94.3\n$\n90.1\n$\n215.7\n$\n107.5\nTotal operating earnings from continuing operations impact from non-GAAP adjustments\n34.4\n15.8\n39.0\n67.0\nNon-GAAP operating earnings from continuing operations\n$\n128.7\n$\n105.9\n$\n254.7\n$\n174.5\nNet earnings (loss) and net earnings (loss) per diluted share reconciliation\nGAAP net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Varian (4)\n$\n73.2\n$\n69.5\n$\n(39.1)\n$\n77.1\nTotal net earnings from continuing operations impact from non-GAAP adjustments\n33.5\n15.0\n244.2\n54.9\nNon-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Varian\n$\n106.7\n$\n84.5\n$\n205.1\n$\n132.0\nGAAP net (loss) earnings per diluted share from continuing operations\n$\n0.79\n$\n0.74\n$\n(0.43)\n$\n0.82\nNon-GAAP net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations\n$\n1.15\n$\n0.90\n$\n2.21\n$\n1.40\nShares used in computing GAAP net earnings per diluted share\n92.6\n93.7\n91.6\n93.9\nShares used in computing non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share\n92.6\n93.7\n92.7\n93.9\n(1)\nIncludes $1.5 million, $1.2 million, $2.7 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, in cost of revenues for the periods presented.\n(2)\nPrimarily includes $16.4 million for the hedging loss related to the Australian dollar purchase price for Sirtex Medical Limited.\n(3)\nRepresents the tax effect of a change in law related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
