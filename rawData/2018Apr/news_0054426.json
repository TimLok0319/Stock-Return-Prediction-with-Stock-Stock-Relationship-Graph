Relative to the first quarter of 2017, we delivered the significant unit margin recovery we anticipated in both our Polymer and Chemical segments. The improved margin profile was the primary contributor to a 35% increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to the first quarter 2017,\" said Kevin M. Fogarty, Kraton's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Specifically, for the first quarter 2018, Adjusted EBITDA for our Polymer segment was $45 million, up 40% compared to the first quarter of 2017, in which segment margins were adversely impacted by a significant increase in raw material costs. Our Chemical segment delivered first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $44 million, and this was up 31% compared to the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to improved margins in our TOFA-based products,\" Fogarty added. \"With respect to our Chemical segment, after two years of delivering impressive cost reductions associated with both acquisition synergy capture initiatives and operational improvements, we believe 2018 is shaping up to be a year of margin recovery versus the cycle lows experienced in 2017.\"\n\"We are also pleased to share that we have successfully addressed the processing issues that certain Cariflex customers experienced with early production runs of the \"direct-connect\" material produced at our Paulinia, Brazil, facility. Our Cariflex customers are processing the direct-connect material, and production volumes in Paulina are increasing. We expect the direct-connect state-of-the-art technology will facilitate efficient capacity expansions moving forward. We have also recently completed our USBC capacity expansion in Berre, France, and we look forward to leveraging the improved cost base and economics that the expansion is expected to provide. Overall market conditions in our paving and roofing markets remain relatively robust as we move from an excellent summer season in South America, where our HiMA technology offerings enjoyed 50% growth in sales volume compared to the first quarter of 2017, into the traditional summer seasons of both North America and Europe. Thus, the timing of our Berre expansion is noteworthy,\" said Fogarty.\n\"Relative to our ongoing efforts to reduce debt and improve our capital structure, during the first quarter we successfully refinanced our Term Loan facility. Through the refinancing we increased borrowings under the Euro tranche and extended the maturity date of the Term Loan. These actions resulted in enhanced flexibility and secured a reduction in annual cash interest expense of nearly six million dollars,\" added Stephen Tremblay, Kraton's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"Debt reduction remains a high priority for Kraton, and although we experienced a modest seasonal increase in debt in the first quarter, we continue to expect that we will exit 2018 with a consolidated net leverage ratio below four turns.\"\nPolymer Segment\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nPerformance Products\n$\n145,730\n$\n141,718\nSpecialty Polymers\n$\n104,018\n$\n90,920\nCariflex™\n$\n39,525\n$\n38,048\nOther\n(202)\n262\n$\n289,071\n$\n270,948\nOperating income\n$\n32,800\n$\n42,530\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (1)\n$\n44,766\n$\n32,055\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) (2)\n15.5\n%\n11.8\n%\n(1)\nSee non-GAAP reconciliations included in the accompanying financial tables for the reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(2)\nDefined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\nQ1 2018 VERSUS Q1 2017 RESULTS\nRevenue for the Polymer segment was $289.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $270.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which included a $12.9 million positive effect from changes in currency exchange rates between the periods. Sales volumes of 77.6 kilotons for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 1.2% compared to three months ended March 31, 2017. Our Specialty Polymers and Cariflex volumes increased 5.7% and 0.5%, respectively, which was partially offset by a decline in Performance Products volumes of 0.4%.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Polymer segment generated Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $44.8 million compared to $32.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflects improved unit margins. Our unit margins during the three months ended March 31, 2017 were adversely impacted by the significant increases in current replacement costs of raw materials and the timing associated with the realization of price increases. The positive effect from changes in currency exchange rates between the periods was $2.1 million.

We have adjusted the three months ended March 31, 2017 to conform to with the 2018 presentation.\nRevenue for the Chemical segment was $213.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $187.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in Chemical segment revenue was attributable to higher average selling prices and a $12.4 million positive effect from changes in currency exchange rates between the periods. Sales volumes were 115.9 kilotons for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of 2.3 kilotons or 1.9%. The Performance Chemicals and Tires volumes increased 0.4% and 7.3%, respectively, which was partially offset by the decline in Adhesives volumes of 8.4%.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Chemical segment generated $43.9 million of Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) compared to $33.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and improved product mix primarily for TOFA and other Performance Chemical upgrades. See a reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA below.\nCASH FLOW AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018 (excluding borrowings under the Kraton Formosa Polymers Corporation (KFPC) Loan Agreement) we increased Kraton Corporation net indebtedness by $20.3 million.\nSummary of principal amounts for indebtedness and a reconciliation of Kraton debt to Kraton net debt and consolidated net debt (non-GAAP):\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(In thousands)\nUSD Tranche\n$\n300,000\n$\n485,000\nEuro Tranche\n388,017\n198,265\n10.5% Senior Notes\n440,000\n440,000\n7.0% Senior Notes\n400,000\n400,000\nABL\n—\n—\nCapital lease\n1,828\n2,086\nKraton debt\n1,529,845\n1,525,351\nKraton cash\n59,358\n75,204\nKraton net debt\n1,470,487\n1,450,147\nKFPC (1) loans\n145,928\n158,349\nKFPC (1) cash\n5,495\n13,848\nKFPC (1) net debt\n140,433\n144,501\nConsolidated net debt\n$\n1,610,920\n$\n1,594,648\n(1)\nThis amount includes all of the indebtedness of our Kraton Formosa Polymers Corporation (KFPC) joint venture, located in Mailiao, Taiwan, which we own a 50% stake in and consolidate within our financial statements.\nOUTLOOK\nWe continue to expect our full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $400 million.\nWith regard to our 2018 debt reduction target, we now expect to reduce consolidated net debt (total debt less cash), by $125 - $150 million, and we therefore expect our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to be below four turns at year-end 2018.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis press release includes the use of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Consolidated Net Debt Leverage Ratio, and Net Debt. Tables included in this earnings release reconcile each of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. For additional information on the impact of the spread between the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") basis of accounting and estimated current replacement cost (\"ECRC\"), see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance including period-to-period comparisons and/or that of other companies in our industry. Further, management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance, and our incentive compensation plan bases incentive compensation payments on our Adjusted EBITDA performance and attainment of net debt reduction, along with other factors. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and in some cases can vary substantially from other measures of our performance. You should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results under U.S. GAAP in the United States.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin: For our consolidated results, EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. For each reporting segment, EBITDA represents operating income before depreciation and amortization, and earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures. Among other limitations EBITDA does not: reflect the significant interest expense on our debt or reflect the significant depreciation and amortization expense associated with our long-lived assets; and EBITDA included herein should not be used for purposes of assessing compliance or non-compliance with financial covenants under our debt agreements. The calculation of EBITDA in our debt agreements includes adjustments, such as extraordinary, non-recurring or one-time charges, proforma cost savings, certain non-cash items, turnaround costs, and other items included in the definition of EBITDA in the debt agreements. Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all the limitations applicable to EBITDA. We prepare Adjusted EBITDA by eliminating from EBITDA the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our on-going performance, including the spread between FIFO and ECRC, but you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, due to volatility in raw material prices, Adjusted EBITDA may, and often does, vary substantially from EBITDA and other performance measures, including net income calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue (for each reporting segment or on a consolidated basis, if applicable). Because of these and other limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: We prepare Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share by eliminating from Diluted Earnings (loss) per Share the impact of a number of non-recurring items we do not consider indicative of our on-going performance, including the spread between FIFO and ECRC.\nNet Debt: We define net debt for Kraton as total debt (excluding debt of KFPC) less cash and cash equivalents. We define consolidated net debt as Kraton net debt plus debt of KFPC less KFPC's cash and cash equivalents. Management uses net debt to determine our outstanding debt obligations that would not readily be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. Management believes that using net debt is useful to investors in determining our leverage since we could choose to use cash and cash equivalents to retire debt. In addition, management believes that presenting Kraton's net debt excluding KFPC is useful because KFPC has its own capital structure.\nConsolidated Net Debt Leverage Ratio: The consolidated net debt leverage ratio is defined as consolidated net debt as of the balance sheet date divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months then ended. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION\nKraton has scheduled a conference call on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results.
