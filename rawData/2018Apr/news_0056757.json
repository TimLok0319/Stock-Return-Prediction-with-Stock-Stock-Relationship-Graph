He added that Bulgaria needs to work to convince all member states and the ECB of its plan.\nBulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, meets the formal criteria to adopt the single currency, before which it would need to spend at least two years in the ERM-2 “waiting room”.\nIts lev currency has been pegged to the euro for two decades and Bulgaria produces fiscal surpluses, keeps inflation at bay and has one of the lowest public debt burden in the EU.\nBut critics say the EU’s poorest member state needs to better align its economy to richer Western peers and prove it can crack down on corruption before it can adopt the euro.\nBulgaria could be the first country to join the ERM-2 since the EU’s banking union was set up. Dombrovskis said it would be up to ECB to decide whether the country should join the union or the euro zone’s precursor first.\nFollowing the biggest financial crisis in the country triggered by the collapse of its fourth largest lender in 2014, Bulgaria sought to join the banking union and put its banks under ECB scrutiny, but these plans have since stalled.\nBorissov said Brussels will hand Bulgaria a detailed road map for euro entry with clear criteria and timelines.\n“What we are working with the European Commission at the moment is to prepare the documents, to hand them in and to get a road map in a month,” he said.\nSpeaking at the same forum, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said he does not see a reason what would stop Bulgaria from entering the ERM-2, adding it would be “hypocritical” if Bulgaria was denied access.
