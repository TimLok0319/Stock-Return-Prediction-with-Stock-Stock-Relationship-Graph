See Appendix for additional information and reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nThe Company expects second quarter 2018 revenues to increase about 1.5% on a sequential basis, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Gross margin in the second quarter is expected to be about 40.0% plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.\nMr. Bozotti commented, \"Despite the weak demand we are experiencing for smartphones in the first half of 2018, we anticipate second quarter and first half revenues to grow year-over-year about 17.5% and 19.8%, respectively, at the mid-point of our guidance range. This will be driven by the continued better than seasonal sales trends in Automotive, Industrial and Internet of Things applications.\n\"For the second half of the year, we see healthy demand, with a strong backlog across all our product groups, end markets, including smartphones, and regions.\"\nThis outlook is based on an assumed effective currency exchange rate of approximately $1.21 = €1.00 for the 2018 second quarter and includes the impact of existing hedging contracts. The second quarter will close on June 30, 2018.\nRecent Corporate Developments\nOn January 25, STMicroelectronics announced Carlo Bozotti's Succession Plan; Deputy CEO Jean-Marc Chery will be proposed as the Sole Member of the Managing Board at the 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and to become the next President & CEO; A newly-formed Executive Committee will become effective upon shareholder approval of Mr. Chery's appointment.

S. GAAP - Non-U.S. GAAP Reconciliation\nIn US$ Million, Except Per Share Data ($)\nThe supplemental non-U.S. GAAP information presented in this press release is unaudited and subject to inherent limitations. Such non-U.S. GAAP information is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measurements. Also, our supplemental non-U.S. GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled non-U.S. GAAP measures used by other companies. Further, specific limitations for individual non-U.S. GAAP measures, and the reasons for presenting non-U.S. GAAP financial information, are set forth in the paragraphs below. To compensate for these limitations, the supplemental non-U.S. GAAP financial information should not be read in isolation, but only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOperating income (loss) before impairment and restructuring charges and one-time items is used by management to help enhance an understanding of ongoing operations and to communicate the impact of the excluded items, such as impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are used by management to help enhance an understanding of ongoing operations and to communicate the impact of the excluded items like impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs attributable to ST and other one-time items, net of the relevant tax impact.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information for investors and management because they measure the Company's capacity to generate profits from its business operations, excluding the effect of acquisitions and expenses related to the rationalizing of its activities and sites that it does not consider to be part of its on-going operating results, thereby offering, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financials, (i) the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's on-going operating results, (ii) the ability to better identify trends in the Company's business and perform related trend analysis, and (iii) an easier way to compare the Company's results of operations against investor and analyst financial models and valuations, which usually exclude these items.\nQ1 2018 Gross Profit Operating Income Net Earnings Corresponding\nEPS U.S. GAAP 888 269 239 0.26 Impairment & Restructuring 21 21 Estimated Income Tax Effect (3) Non-U.S GAAP 888 290 257 0.28\nQ4 2017 Gross Profit Operating Income Net Earnings Corresponding\nEPS U.S. GAAP 1,003 411 308 0.34 Impairment & Restructuring 20 20 Estimated Income Tax Effect (1) Non-U.S GAAP 1,003 431 327 0.36\nQ1 2017 Gross Profit Operating Income Net Earnings Corresponding\nEPS U.S. GAAP 686 132 108 0.12 Impairment & Restructuring 5 5 Estimated Income Tax Effect (1) Non-U.S GAAP 686 137 112 0.12 (Appendix - continued)\nNet Financial Position (non-U.S. GAAP measure) represents the difference between our total financial resources and our total financial debt. Our total financial resources include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term deposits, and our total financial debt includes short-term debt, including bank overdrafts, and long-term debt, as represented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net Financial Position is not a U.S. GAAP measure but we believe it provides useful information for investors and management because it gives evidence of our global position either in terms of net indebtedness or net cash by measuring our capital resources based on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the total level of our financial indebtedness. In addition, our definition of Net Financial Position may differ from definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nNet Financial Position (US$ Million) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 April 1, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 1,791 1,759 1,641 Short term deposits 14 - - Marketable securities 429 431 335 Total financial resources 2,234 2,190 1,976 Short-term debt (119) (118) (117) Long-term debt (1,593) (1,583) (1,341) Total financial debt (1,712) (1,701) (1,458) Net financial position - Non-U.S. GAAP 522 489 518 Free Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure) is defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible, intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nFree cash flow (US$ Million) Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 Net cash from operating activities 455 587 289 Net cash used in investing activities (374) (442) (227) Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities, investment in short-term deposits, restricted cash 14 - - Free cash flow 95 145 62 Attachment\nST Q1 2018 results.pdf\nSource:STMicroelectronics N.V.", "external_links": ["http://www.st.com/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aDVEJRpLnqLFZ8TPHnsq-oLhukPdiH6FzWueDqZl8v8XGDXijcbhJlKu52JT1D_X42EBy5WaVKzuB1wnNV2tur_BQtzCIxKSIk0XO8JmUw4=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Urw0aLeZOqgpQZxcPEefnKJ8ge-ar_yKflr5Rk73stmbjWIcY6JS0J5Keh26ICX5RwCnlKFMyMJwkzBtiSmSjA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Urw0aLeZOqgpQZxcPEefnBBHoQ6yKnaJalzBD6ZlbbuNHZPO6sFIkCDhLNEjEiVgby-W5_4kcLi_Qbz5bugs9g==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Hbi511szMwaFd0acsxrPQo6cwSotRhk9mfHETsxy3IBUbd3Y9OQMWoPa6S6iA0BuZ_aZPe6qpNYqX_pWnpdGMHQ65Qlck-xhGfmJz_rQ47Y=", "https://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/fae14388-cfc6-4975-8536-be0c78dd17f5"], "published": "2018-04-25T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T08:22:15.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
