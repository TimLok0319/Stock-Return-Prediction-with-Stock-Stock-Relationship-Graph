GAAP earnings per share was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.58 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share expanded to $0.68 from $0.59 in the first quarter of 2017. Special items for the first quarter of 2018, which primarily included environmental remediation and legal costs, resulted in a net after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $0.09 per share (see Attachment 1). In the prior year first quarter, special items were $0.9 million, or $0.01 per share.\n\"I'm very pleased to report a strong start to the year, as we reported adjusted EPS growth of 15% for the first quarter,\" said Robert M. Patterson, chairman, president and chief executive officer, PolyOne Corporation. \"Our Color, Additives & Inks (CAI) segment led the way with record first quarter operating income, driven by both organic gains and recent acquisitions.\"\n\"Our investments in sales, marketing and technology resources continue to drive our performance,\" added Mr. Patterson. \"Over the last three years we have increased the number of commercial associates by over 20%. These investments, coupled with recent specialty acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange, led to a 13% increase in overall sales with every segment and region contributing.\"\nThe company noted that in the first quarter, organic sales increased 6% and recent specialty acquisitions added 4%, while favorable foreign exchange added 3%.\n\"We have a track record of generating strong free cash flow, and with the exception of seasonal working capital investment, this was once again the case in the first quarter,\" said Bradley C. Richardson, executive vice president and chief financial officer, PolyOne Corporation. \"Our cash generation allowed us to repurchase one million shares of our stock during the first quarter, while completing the acquisition of IQAP, a specialty colorant and additive business based in Spain. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we ended March with over $470 million of available liquidity.\"\n\"IQAP is off to a great start this year. We are very excited to have them as part of our team as one of five specialty acquisitions we completed in the last 18 months,\" Mr. Patterson added. \"While we are pleased with their combined early integration success, the best is yet to come. With our invest-to-grow strategy, we better serve new and existing markets and applications, and in doing so, accelerate sales growth and margin expansion for us and our customers.\"\n\"Strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2018 is our expectation, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver,\" Mr. Patterson concluded. \"Our strategic commercial investments and world class customer-first service continue to differentiate us as we relentlessly focus on our proven four pillar strategy. We look forward to sharing updates on these investments, key innovation platforms, and expectations for our recent and future acquisitions, at our upcoming Investor Day to be held on May 10 th .\"\nConference Call\nThe company will conduct a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, April 26, 2018.

In addition, operating income before the effect of special items is a component of PolyOne annual and long-term employee incentive plans and is used in debt covenant computations. Senior management believes these measures are useful to investors because they allow for comparison to PolyOne's performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure PolyOne's operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on timing, frequency and magnitude.
