In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"aim,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"ongoing,\" \"goal,\" \"can,\" \"seek,\" \"target\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements reflect current views concerning future events, including the planned completion of the tender offer and the merger, and are based on a number of assumptions that could ultimately prove inaccurate. As a general matter, forward-looking statements are those focused upon anticipated events or trends, expectations, and beliefs relating to matters that are not historical in nature. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to RPX's operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of RPX. Among others, the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: (i) uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer and the merger; (ii) uncertainties as to how many RPX stockholders will tender their shares of RPX common stock in the tender offer; (iii) the possibility that competing offers will be made, (iv) the possibility that various closing conditions for the transaction may not be satisfied or waived; (v) the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring RPX to pay a termination fee; (vi) risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the tender offer and the merger is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (vii) the possibility that the transaction may not be timely completed, if at all; (viii) the risk that, prior to the completion of the transaction, if at all, RPX's business and its relationships with employees, collaborators, vendors and other business partners could experience significant disruption due to transaction-related uncertainty; (ix) the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the tender offer or the merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; and (x) the risks and uncertainties pertaining to RPX's business, including those detailed under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in RPX's public periodic filings with the SEC, as well as the tender offer materials filed by Purchaser and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement filed by RPX in connection with the tender offer. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth in RPX's SEC reports, including, without limitation, the risks described in RPX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as amended, and in RPX's Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, each of which is on file with the SEC, and in any subsequent periodic reports of RPX.
