(\"Mountain Province\", or the \"Company\") (TSX and NASDAQ: MPVD) today announces its financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.\nHighlights\nEarnings from mine operations of $24.6 million and net income of $0.7 million or $0.00 per share for the first quarter of 2018 with adjusted EBITDA 1 of $33.2 million. Included in the determination of net income is an unrealized foreign exchange loss for the quarter of $10.3 million on the translation of the Company's USD-denominated long-term debt. The Company did not record any sales in the comparable period for 2017 as sales were still credited against mine construction costs in that period.\nTwo tender sales conducted in the first quarter of 2018, through the Company's diamond broker based in Antwerp, Belgium. Mountain Province anticipates conducting three tender sales in the second quarter, two tender sales in the third quarter and three tender sales in the fourth quarter.\nTotal sales of $67 million (US$52 million) in the first quarter of 2018. Revenue was realized through the first two tender sales of the 2018 year. Average realization in the first quarter was $126 Canadian dollars per carat sold (US$99 per carat). The third sale of the year began at the end of the quarter and closed in early April, yielding $33.3 million (US$26.4 million) in tender sale proceeds as reported in the news release of April 18, 2018.\nApproximately 786,000 tonnes of ore were treated through the process plant and 1,641,000 carats recovered, on a 100% basis, for an average recovered grade of 2.09 carats per tonne (\"cpt\"), in line with budget. The Company's 49% attributable share of diamond production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately 804,000 carats.\nCash costs of production, including capitalized stripping costs 1 , for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $76 per tonne of ore processed and $37 per carat recovered.\nPioneering waste removal at Hearne continued throughout the quarter, and in April the first ore was mined from the Hearne pit. The plant will begin processing Hearne ore during this second quarter of 2018.\nCustomer participation rates at the Company's two tender sales concluded in the first quarter were very strong. The average number of customers placing bids increased by 30% over 2017 levels and the number of bids received per lot increased from an average of eleven in 2017 to over fourteen this quarter. The average number of lots per sale (164, compared with an average 125 in 2017) was elevated due to the large number of individual fancy and special stones which were marketed as individual stone lots.\nQuarter end cash position of $28.7 million and net working capital of $113.5 million, with the US$50 million revolving credit facility remaining undrawn.\n1\nCash costs of production, including capitalized stripping costs, and adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures with no standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS. See the Non-IFRS Measures section of the Company's March 31, 2018 MD&A for explanation and reconciliation.\nDavid Whittle, the Company's Interim President and CEO, commented, \"Mountain Province recorded a solid start to the year, generating $33.2 million in adjusted EBITDA in a two sale quarter. We remain on pace to achieve our production guidance for the year. Rough diamond markets in general continued to firm notably through the quarter, with strong demand and price increases reported across all product categories, supported by robust retail jewellery sales reported from both the US and Asian markets. Ending the quarter with $113.5 million in net working capital, and with our US$50 million revolver remaining undrawn, our balance sheet is strong and growing.\"\nMr. Whittle continued, \"Consistent with our stated commitment to return value to our shareholders, the Board anticipates determining and declaring our inaugural dividend in conjunction with the preparation and release of our second quarter results.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended\nThree months ended\n(in millions of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nSales\n$\n66,565\n-\nCarats sold\n000's carats\n527\n-\nAverage price per carat sold\n$/carat\n126\n-\nCost of sales per carat*\n$/carat\n80\n-\nEarnings from mine operations per carat\n$\n46\n-\nEarnings from mine operations\n%\n37%\n-\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n3,589\n3,428\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n20,105\n(3,428)\nNet income (loss) for the period\n$\n67\n(2,144)\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share\n$\n0.00\n(0.01)\n* This cost of sales per carat includes the cost of acquiring 51% of the fancies and specials which have been sold, after having been won in a tendering process with De Beers.\nGK Mine Operations\nThe following table summarizes key operating statistics for the Gahcho Kué diamond mine (the \"GK mine\") in the first quarter of 2018.

The processing plant continues to achieve higher throughput than originally anticipated, having achieved and broken daily throughput records in a given 24 hour period during the first quarter of 2018. The plant recorded an average processing rate over the quarter of 8,733 tonnes per day, a 60% increase over the first quarter of 2017 as the mine was ramping up towards commercial production during the comparative period.\nAll ore processed during the first quarter of 2018 was sourced from the 5034 pit. Approximately 1.9 million tonnes of waste were mined from the Hearne pit in the quarter, as it was being prepared for production. First ore from the Hearne pit was mined subsequent to the quarter in April 2018, and processing of Hearne ore through the plant will commence in the second quarter.\nThe winter road program was safely and successfully executed during the first quarter. The final shipments of fuel, explosives and other supplies arrived in early April 2018, meeting the targeted delivery schedule.\nConference Call\nFull details of the financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are described in Mountain Province's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements with accompanying notes and related Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimated production and mine life of the project of Mountain Province; the realization of mineral reserve estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future production; costs of production; the future price of diamonds; the estimation of mineral reserves and resources; the ability to manage debt; capital expenditures; the ability to obtain permits for operations; liquidity; tax rates; and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Except for statements of historical fact relating to Mountain Province, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made, and are based on a number of assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of Mountain Province and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include variations in ore grade or recovery rates, changes in market conditions, changes in project parameters, mine sequencing; production rates; cash flow; risks relating to the availability and timeliness of permitting and governmental approvals; supply of, and demand for, diamonds; fluctuating commodity prices and currency exchange rates, the possibility of project cost overruns or unanticipated costs and expenses, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry, failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\nThese factors are discussed in greater detail in Mountain Province's most recent Annual Information Form and in the most recent MD&A filed on SEDAR, which also provide additional general assumptions in connection with these statements. Mountain Province cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who base themselves on forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail.
