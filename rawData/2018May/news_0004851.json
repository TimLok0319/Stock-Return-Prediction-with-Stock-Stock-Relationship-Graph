(NYSE: CTT) reported higher revenue, an increase in GAAP net loss, and an increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Results were driven by a year-over-year increase in harvest volume, higher pulpwood pricing and the strong financial performance of the Dawsonville Bluffs joint venture.\nCatchMark today also declared a cash dividend of $0.135 per share for its common stockholders of record on May 31, 2018, payable on June 15, 2018.\nJerry Barag, CatchMark's President and CEO said, \"We had another solid operating quarter benefiting from increased harvest volume fueled by last year's acquisitions and robust returns on our investment in the Dawsonville Bluffs joint venture. We adjusted our harvest mix to take advantage of increased pulpwood pricing and we continued to increase our delivered sales. Overall, we remain very much on track to meet our 2018 operating plan and maintain a healthy dividend.\"\nResults Overview\nFirst quarter 2018 operating results included:\nGenerated revenues of $24.1 million, compared to $23.1 million in first quarter 2017, a 4% increase. Incurred a net loss of $3.4 million in accordance with GAAP, compared to $2.0 million in the first quarter 2017, an increase primarily resulting from a non-recurring, non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs. Realized Adjusted EBITDA of $14.9 million, compared to $10.6 million in the first quarter 2017, a 40% increase. Increased timber sales volume by 12% to 574,785 tons, primarily from properties acquired in 2017. Recognized $1.8 million in income from the unconsolidated Dawsonville Bluffs joint venture. Completed timberland sales of approximately 2,200 acres for $4.3 million. Paid a dividend of $0.135 per share to stockholders of record on March 16, 2018.\nCatchMark continued to strengthen its balance sheet and maximize available capital to execute its growth strategy. In March 2018, the company completed a successful public capital raise of $72.5 million to pursue acquisitions and investments from its robust investment pipeline. In addition, CatchMark mitigated exposure to rising interest rates by converting $50 million of outstanding debt from floating to fixed rate through executing two interest rate swap transactions in February 2018. As of March 31, 2018, $300.0 million remained available under the company's multi-draw term and revolving credit facilities for direct acquisitions of timberland properties, joint venture investments and working capital needs.\nBarag said: \"We continue to defer some harvests to future periods when we expect to capture better pricing. Pent-up demand for housing continues to build from sustained below-average new U.S. home construction. But recent activity suggests the start of a turnaround and at some point the demand surge will encourage greater homebuilding activity especially given current positive economic drivers. Our timberland sales completed and under contract remain on target to meet plan for the year and we are very encouraged by opportunities presenting themselves in the acquisition market given our very active current pipeline.\"\nResults for Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nCatchMark's revenues increased to $24.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $23.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in timber sales revenue of $2.2 million. Gross timber sales revenue increased 13% primarily as a result of a 12% increase in harvest volume as well as an increase in delivered sales as a percentage of total volume. Timberland sales revenue decreased to $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as a result of fewer acres sold during the quarter. Income from unconsolidated joint venture was $1.8 million reflecting CatchMark's execution of its investment strategy in Dawsonville Bluffs. Net loss increased to $3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in interest expense caused by a one-time, non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs.\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2017\nChanges attributable to:\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\n(in thousands)\nPrice/Mix\nVolume\nTimber sales (1)\nPulpwood\n$\n8,273\n$\n90\n$\n2,013\n$\n10,376\nSawtimber (2)\n8,219\n28\n30\n8,277\n$\n16,492\n$\n118\n$\n2,043\n$\n18,653\n(1) Timber sales are presented on a gross basis.\n(2) Includes chip-n-saw and sawtimber.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe discussion below is intended to enhance the reader's understanding of our operating performance and our ability to satisfy lender requirements. Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depletion, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance. EBITDA is defined by the SEC; however, we have excluded certain other expenses which we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of our timberland portfolio, and we refer to this measure as \"Adjusted EBITDA.\" As such, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income, cash from operations, or other financial statement data present in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of our operating performance. Due to the significant amount of timber assets subject to depletion and the significant amount of financing subject to interest and amortization expense, management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial condition and performance. By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with the reconciliation below, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our ongoing results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, or our future requirements for capital expenditures; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on, our debt; and Although depletion is a non-cash charge, we will incur expenses to replace the timber being depleted in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash requirements for such expenses.\nDue to these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We further believe that our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measurement provides information that is useful to analysts and investors because they are important indicators of the strength of our operations and the performance of our business. Our credit agreement contains a minimum debt service coverage ratio based, in part, on Adjusted EBITDA since this measure is representative of adjusted income available for interest payments.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $14.9 million, a $4.3 million increase from the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to contributions from the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture and an increase in net timber sales.\nOur reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended March 30, 2018 and 2017 follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet loss\n$\n(3,385)\n$\n(1,978)\nAdd:\nDepletion\n7,062\n6,057\nBasis of timberland sold, lease terminations and other (1)\n2,856\n3,517\nAmortization (2)\n1,725\n304\nDepletion, amortization, and basis of timberland and mitigation credits sold included in income from unconsolidated joint venture (3)\n3,256\n—\nStock-based compensation expense\n765\n420\nInterest expense (2)\n2,581\n2,294\nOther (4)\n35\n3\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n14,895\n$\n10,617\n(1)\nIncludes non-cash basis of timber and timberland assets written-off related to timberland sold, terminations of timberland leases and casualty losses.\n(2)\nFor the purpose of the above reconciliation, amortization includes amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of intangible lease assets, and amortization of mainline road costs, which are included in either interest expense, land rent expense, or other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n(3)\nReflects our share of depletion, amortization, and basis of timberland and mitigation credits sold of the unconsolidated joint venture.\n(4)\nIncludes certain cash expenses that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations of our timberland portfolio on an on-going basis, including costs required to be expensed by GAAP related to acquisitions transactions, joint ventures or new business initiatives.\nConference Call/Webcast\nThe company will host a conference call and live webcast at 10 a.m. ET on Friday, May 4, 2018 to discuss these results.
