Net income attributable to Atlantic Power was $15.9 million versus a loss of $(2.7) million in the year-ago period, as discussed above. Project Adjusted EBITDA decreased $10.4 million from the 2017 period, primarily due to expiration of the PPAs at Kapuskasing and North Bay (in Ontario) in December 2017 and the cessation of operations at the Company's three projects in San Diego in February 2018, partially offset by higher Project Adjusted EBITDA at Morris and more modest increases at other projects. Despite lower Project Adjusted EBITDA, Cash provided by operating activities increased $16.2 million from the year-ago period, mostly because of a decrease in working capital at the Company's Ontario and San Diego projects and because of lower cash interest payments.\n\"Although Project Adjusted EBITDA declined in the first quarter due to PPA expirations in Ontario and San Diego, results exceeded our expectations, as our Morris project benefited from higher power prices and energy sales during the extremely cold weather earlier this year and our Mamquam project experienced higher water flows,\" said James J. Moore, Jr., President and CEO of Atlantic Power. \"During the quarter we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and credit profile by repaying $32.4 million of term loan and project debt and refinancing the majority of our 2019 convertible debenture maturities. We ended the first quarter with liquidity of $205 million, including approximately $32 million of discretionary cash, after repurchasing $6.4 million of common shares and $4 million (US$ equivalent) of preferred shares in March. In April, we repurchased another $1.1 million of common shares and executed the third successful re-pricing of our term loan and revolver, which will further reduce our cash interest payments on those facilities by approximately $8.5 million through their respective maturity dates.\"\nAtlantic Power Corporation\nTable 1 – Summary of Financial Results\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise stated)\nUnaudited\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nFinancial Highlights\nProject revenue\n$80.0\n$98.4\nProject income\n28.3\n25.3\nNet income (loss) attributable to Atlantic Power Corporation\n15.9\n(2.7)\nCash provided by operating activities\n50.3\n34.1\nProject Adjusted EBITDA\n53.4\n63.8\nAll amounts are in U.S. dollars and are approximate unless otherwise indicated. Project Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; therefore, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Please refer to \"Non-GAAP Disclosures\" on page 12 of this news release for an explanation and a reconciliation of \"Project Adjusted EBITDA\" as used in this news release to Project income (loss), the most directly comparable measure on a GAAP basis, and Net loss.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nResults for the first quarter of 2018 were adversely affected, as expected, by the expirations of the PPAs at Kapuskasing and North Bay in Ontario at year-end 2017, the early terminations of the PPAs for the three San Diego projects effective March 1, 2018, and maintenance costs incurred to return Tunis to service later this year. Positive variances occurred at Morris, which benefited from higher power prices and demand levels in January due to extremely cold temperatures, and at Mamquam, which experienced water flows that were significantly better than average. A non-cash foreign exchange gain and reduced interest expense resulted in higher net income for the quarter, although these factors do not affect Project Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet income, Project Income and Project Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income attributable to Atlantic Power Corporation for the first quarter of 2018 was $15.9 million compared to a net loss of $(2.7) million in the first quarter of 2017. The $18.6 million improvement was primarily attributable to a $3.0 million increase in Project income (discussed below); a $10.7 million increase in unrealized foreign exchange gain, most of which was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in Canadian dollars (due to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar since December 31, 2017); a $2.2 million reduction in corporate interest expense as a result of debt repayment and re-pricing of the Company's credit facilities; a $2.0 million change in fair value of the conversion option derivative related to the Series E convertible debentures; and a $3.9 million gain on the repurchase of the Company's preferred shares.\nProject income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $3.0 million to $28.3 million from $25.3 million in the year-ago period. Lower project income at Kapuskasing, North Bay, Tunis and the three San Diego projects was more than offset by increased project income at Williams Lake, due to lower depreciation expense resulting from an impairment recorded in 2017, and higher contracted firm energy revenues; Morris, due to higher generation levels and higher energy and capacity prices; Nipigon, mostly due to an increase in the fair value of a derivative; Piedmont, due to lower interest expense following the repayment of the project debt in full in October 2017; Frederickson, due to lower amortization expense resulting from an impairment recorded in 2017; and Mamquam, which experienced higher water flows than the year-ago period (as well as against average levels).\nProject Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 declined $10.4 million to $53.4 million from $63.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of contracts at Kapuskasing and North Bay at year-end 2017 (-$14.9 million); the termination of PPAs for all three San Diego projects effective March 1, 2018 (-$2.7 million); and maintenance expenses incurred at Tunis in preparation for restart (-$2.6 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increases at Morris, due to higher generation levels and higher power prices resulting from extremely cold temperatures in January, a higher capacity price realized in the PJM capacity auction for this year, and higher steam and ancillary services revenue ($3.6 million); Nipigon, due to a higher capacity rate under the contract ($1.7 million); Williams Lake, due to higher firm energy revenues ($1.0 million); Mamquam, due to higher water flows ($0.9 million), and more modest increases at several other projects, including a $0.7 million benefit from Selkirk, which had posted a loss in the first quarter of 2017 and was sold in November 2017.\nCash Flow\nCash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 increased $16.2 million to $50.3 million from $34.1 million in the year-ago period. The impact on operating cash flow of a $10.4 million reduction in Project Adjusted EBITDA was more than offset by a $4.5 million reduction in cash interest payments (resulting from debt repayment and a lower spread on the Company's credit facilities) and $20.9 million of net favorable changes in working capital, including an $18.3 million decrease in working capital at Kapuskasing, North Bay, Nipigon and the San Diego projects. The PPAs for five of these projects expired between the end of 2017 and March 31, 2018.\nCash used in investing activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $(1.1) million, slightly lower than the $(2.0) million in the first quarter of 2017. This was the result of lower capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $(45.7) million as compared to $(29.5) million in the year-ago period. The Company issued $92.2 million (US$ equivalent) of Series E convertible debentures and used the proceeds to redeem all of its Series C convertible debentures and most of its Series D convertible debentures, totaling $(88.1) million. The Company also repaid $(32.4) million of term loan and project debt, repurchased $(6.4) million of common shares and $(4.0) million (US$ equivalent) of preferred shares. It also paid $(2.2) million of preferred dividends. In the comparable 2017 period, the Company repaid $(27.4) million of term loan and project debt and paid $(2.1) million of preferred dividends.\nFor the quarter, the Company had a $3.5 million net increase in cash and cash equivalents.\nLiquidity and Balance Sheet\nLiquidity\nAs shown in Table 2, the Company's liquidity at March 31, 2018 was $205.1 million, an increase of $6.9 million from the December 31, 2017 level. The Company's unrestricted cash of $82.6 million includes $39.2 million at the parent, of which the Company considers approximately $32 million to be discretionary cash available for general corporate purposes. The $10.5 million reduction in cash at the parent from the December 31, 2017 level was primarily attributable to the repurchase of $10.4 million of common and preferred shares in March 2018.\nAtlantic Power Corporation\nTable 2 – Liquidity (in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nMar. 31, 2018\nDec. 31, 2017\nCash and cash equivalents, parent\n$39.2\n$49.7\nCash and cash equivalents, projects\n43.4\n29.0\nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n82.6\n78.7\nRevolving credit facility\n200.0\n200.0\nLetters of credit outstanding\n(77.5)\n(80.5)\nAvailability under revolving credit facility\n122.5\n119.5\nTotal liquidity\n$205.1\n$198.2\nExcludes restricted cash of:\n$5.7\n$6.2\nBalance Sheet\nDebt Repayment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repaid $30 million of the APLP Holdings term loan and amortized $2.4 million of project-level debt. This is consistent with the Company's plan to repay $90 million of the term loan and amortize $10 million of project debt in 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company's consolidated debt was $810 million, excluding unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, and the Company's consolidated leverage ratio (consolidated gross debt to trailing 12-month consolidated Adjusted EBITDA) was 3.2 times.\nConvertible Debentures\nAs previously reported, on January 29, 2018, the Company closed the offering (the \"Series E Offering\") of Cdn$100.0 million of 6.00% Series E convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (the \"Series E Debentures\"). On February 2, 2018, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option, which resulted in the Company issuing another Cdn$15.0 million of Series E Debentures. The Series E Debentures have a maturity date of January 31, 2025. The conversion rate on the Series E Debentures is approximately 238.0952 common shares per Cdn$1,000 principal amount, representing a conversion price of Cdn$4.20 per common share. Net proceeds from the offering after expenses totaled Cdn$109.1 million.\nThe Company used the net proceeds from the Series E Offering to redeem, in full, the outstanding principal amount of US$42.5 million of 5.75% Series C convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (which have a maturity date of June 2019) (the \"Series C Debentures\") and to redeem Cdn$56.2 million, on a pro rata basis, of the outstanding principal amount of the 6.00% Series D extendible convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (which have a maturity date of December 2019) (the \"Series D Debentures\"). The redemptions occurred on March 5 and March 7, 2018, respectively. Following the redemptions, the Company has Cdn$24.7 million of Series D Debentures outstanding ($19.2 million on a US$ equivalent basis).\nDebt Maturity Profile\nAs a result of the convertible debenture transactions, the Company has no bullet maturities until December 2019, the maturity date of the remaining Cdn$24.7 million of Series D Debentures. The Series D Debentures are callable at par at any time prior to maturity. There are no bullet maturities in 2020 or 2021. The Company's $200 million revolving credit facility matures in April 2022. The $510 million APLP Holdings term loan has an April 2023 maturity, although it is expected to be more than 80% repaid by the maturity date. The Cdn$115.0 million of Series E Debentures have a January 2025 maturity date.\nRe-pricing of Term Loan and Revolver\nAs previously reported in its April 19, 2018 press release, the Company executed a re-pricing of the APLP Holdings term loan and revolving credit facility, reducing the interest rate margin on the term loan and revolver by 50 basis points, to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. This represented the third re-pricing for these facilities since April 2017, resulting in a cumulative reduction in the spread of 200 basis points. The Company expects to realize, before related transaction costs, $2.1 million of interest cost savings in 2018 and $8.5 million over the remaining terms of the facilities, as a result of the 50 basis point reduction. The combined savings of the three re-pricing transactions are expected to be approximately $41 million over the remaining terms of the facilities. Transaction costs associated with the re-pricing will be included in interest expense in the second quarter of 2018.\nNormal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) Update\nOn December 29, 2017, the Company put in place an NCIB for its common and preferred shares and convertible debentures. It did not make any purchases under the NCIB in January or February. In March and April 2018, the Company purchased and canceled approximately 3.5 million common shares at a total cost of $7.4 million, or an average price of $2.10 per share. In March 2018, the Company purchased and canceled 237,500 shares of the 4.85% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred, Series 1 at Cdn$15.25 per share and 83,095 shares of the Cumulative Floating Rate Preferred, Series 3 at Cdn$17.80 per share, for a total payment of Cdn$5.1 million.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company has not provided guidance for Project income or Net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable GAAP metrics, including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses. These factors, which generally do not affect cash flow, are not included in Project Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company is reaffirming its guidance for 2018 Project Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $170 to $185 million. As discussed in the Company's March 1, 2018 year-end 2017 earnings release, when it initiated 2018 guidance, the expected decrease from 2017 Project Adjusted EBITDA of $288.8 million is primarily attributable to the impact of PPA expirations in 2017 and 2018 and the non-recurrence of revenues received under the OEFC settlement in 2017. Other factors contributing to lower Project Adjusted EBITDA include maintenance expense associated with a planned gas turbine overhaul at Manchief in the second quarter of 2018 and restart costs for Tunis. The majority of the Tunis costs are being incurred in the first six months of 2018 and a substantial majority will be expensed. The Company's 2018 guidance assumes average water conditions as compared to favorable conditions in 2017. These negative factors are expected to be partially offset by increases at several other projects, including Morris (a higher PJM capacity price) and Frederickson (maintenance outage in 2017).\nTable 3 provides a bridge of the Company's 2018 Project Adjusted EBITDA guidance to Cash provided by operating activities. For purposes of providing this bridge to a cash flow measure, the impact of changes in working capital is assumed to be nil. The impact of lower Project Adjusted EBITDA on cash provided by operating activities is expected to be mitigated by a $27 million reduction in cash interest payments in 2018 relative to 2017, which is $2 million better than the Company's previous expectation as a result of the recent re-pricing of its term loan and revolver. The reduction in cash interest payments is attributable to a full year benefit from the $166 million of debt repaid in 2017, a partial year benefit from the expected debt repayment of $100 million in 2018, the lower interest rate on the term loan and revolver, and the non-recurrence of the Piedmont interest rate swap termination cost incurred in 2017.\nAtlantic Power Corporation\nTable 3 – Bridge of 2018 Project Adjusted EBITDA Guidance to Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\n2018 Guidance\n(initiated 3/1/18)\nProject Adjusted EBITDA\n$170 - $185\nAdjustment for equity method projects (1)\n(2)\nCorporate G&A expense\n(22)\nCash interest payments\n(45)\nCash taxes\n(4)\nOther (including changes in working capital)\n-\nCash provided by operating activities\n$95 - $110\nNote: For the purpose of providing a bridge of Project Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a cash flow measure, the impact of changes in working capital on Cash provided by operating activities is assumed to be nil.\n(1) For equity method projects, represents difference between Project Adjusted EBITDA and cash distribution from equity method projects.\nCommercial and Operational Updates\n2018-2019 PPA Expirations\nThe Company has five projects with PPAs that expired in 2018 or are scheduled to expire in 2019.\nNaval Station, NTC and North Island (San Diego) . As previously reported, the projects ceased operations on February 7, 2018 when the land use agreements with the U.S. Navy that provided the Company the right to use the sites expired. The early termination of the PPAs with San Diego Gas & Electric was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission on March 1, 2018, and the appeal period for that approval has since expired, thus eliminating the risk of any potential liabilities to the Company arising from the early termination. Although the Company has executed new power contracts for all three projects, those contracts are conditioned upon the Company obtaining the right to remain on the Navy sites for the contract term, which appears unlikely. The Company is proceeding with plans to decommission the three projects, which is required by its land use agreements with the Navy, and is in the process of defining the scope of work and timing with the Navy.\nWilliams Lake (British Columbia) . Since April 2, 2018, the project has been operating under a short-term extension of the energy purchase agreement with BC Hydro. The extension is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019, or September 30, 2019 at the option of BC Hydro. The amended contract is subject to the approval of the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC), which in early April ordered a written hearing process that commenced recently. If the BCUC has not approved the amended contract within a specified timeframe, either party has the right to terminate the contract.\nKenilworth . In late April 2018, Merck, which is the customer under the Energy Services Agreement (ESA) at Kenilworth, exercised the first of its three one-year renewal options under the contract. The expiration date of the ESA is now September 30, 2019. The economics of the extension are substantially similar to those under the original ESA term.\nTunis Planned Restart\nThe Company is continuing work to return Tunis to service as a simple-cycle plant and recently gave notice to the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator that it plans to restart operations on July 1, 2018. The estimated $5 to $6 million cost of the restart is being expensed, with the majority of these costs to be incurred in the first six months of 2018. The project has a 15-year PPA that will commence with commercial operation. Under the PPA, Tunis will receive monthly capacity payments and will earn energy revenues for those periods during which it operates.\nManchief Outage\nThe Company began a major gas turbine outage at its Manchief project in mid-April, which is expected to run through late May. This is similar to the one undertaken in 2015 for the project's other gas turbine. The costs will be expensed. The Company expects the outage to reduce Project Adjusted EBITDA for Manchief by approximately $7 million in the second quarter of 2018.\nMaintenance and Capex\nThere has been no change to the Company's planned maintenance expenses of approximately $34.8 million and capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 million for 2018. The modest increase in maintenance expense relative to the 2017 level ($32.6 million) is associated with the Tunis restart work and the Manchief gas turbine outage, partially offset by lower maintenance expense at Frederickson and other projects.\nSupplementary Information Regarding Non-GAAP Disclosures\nA discussion of non-GAAP disclosures and schedules reconciling Project Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to the comparable GAAP measure, can be found on page 12 of this release.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nAtlantic Power's management team will host a telephone conference call and webcast on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 8:30 AM ET.
