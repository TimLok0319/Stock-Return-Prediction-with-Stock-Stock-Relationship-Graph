(\"Third Point Re\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:TPRE) today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Point Re reported a net loss available to common shareholders of $26.0 million, or $(0.26) per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $104.2 million, or $0.98 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, diluted book value per share decreased by $0.26 per share, or 1.7%, to $15.39 per share as of March 31, 2018, from $15.65 per share as of December 31, 2017.\n\"During the first quarter, we generated premiums written of $378 million, an increase of 159% compared to the prior year's quarter. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 104.5%, compared to 106.3% in the prior year's first quarter,\" commented Rob Bredahl, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We experienced significant premium growth in the first quarter compared to the prior year, driven by new business and the timing of certain renewals. We were pleased with the business written during the quarter, which was generally at improved terms and underlying pricing. We expect this to contribute to an improvement in our underwriting results as this premium is earned. Our investment returns and overall return on equity reflected a modest loss for the quarter, however, we remain confident that the improvements in our underwriting results as well as Third Point LLC's proven track record will generate attractive returns to our shareholders over time.\"\nThe following table shows certain key financial metrics for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n2018\n2017\n($ in millions, except for per share\ndata and ratios)\nGross premiums written\n$\n378.4\n$\n146.4\nNet premiums earned\n$\n142.5\n$\n138.0\nNet underwriting loss (1)\n$\n(6.4)\n$\n(8.7)\nCombined ratio (1)\n104.5%\n106.3%\nNet investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n(0.2)%\n5.8%\nNet investment income (loss)\n$\n(2.2)\n$\n128.5\nNet investment income on float (2)\n$\n2.6\n$\n36.1\nNet income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders\n$\n(26.0)\n$\n104.2\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\n$\n(0.26)\n$\n0.98\nChange in diluted book value per share (2)\n(1.7)%\n6.7%\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders (2)\n(1.6)%\n7.4%\nNet investments managed by Third Point LLC (3)\n$\n2,532.8\n$\n2,589.9\nInvested asset leverage (3)\n1.58\n1.56\n(1)\nSee the accompanying Segment Reporting for a calculation of net underwriting loss and combined ratio.\n(2)\nNet investment income on float, change in diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders are non-GAAP financial measures.

Within the long equity portfolio, performance within the Consumer and Industrials sectors detracted from positive returns in the financials and technology, media and telecommunications sectors. Within credit, the structured credit generated gains amidst a favorable backdrop for the U.S. mortgage-backed securities in the portfolio. The macro and other strategies contributed gains through profitable hedges.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased and retired 1,638,308 of its common shares in the open market for $23.8 million at a weighted average cost, including commissions, of $14.55 per share.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of $176.2 million of additional common shares under its share repurchase program.\nImpact of tax reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. The following is a summary of the estimated impact of key elements of the Tax Act that could potentially impact the Company:\nBase Erosion Anti-abuse Tax (\"BEAT\")\nThe Company does not anticipate any impact from this provision of the Tax Act as Third Point Reinsurance (USA) Ltd. does not expect to exceed the $500 million gross receipts threshold for application of the BEAT.\nChanges to rate and other deductions\nThe U.S. federal corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21%. The Company does not anticipate material changes to its effective tax rate as a result of the other changes to deductions within the Tax Act.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company (\"PFIC\")\nThe Tax Act modifies the active insurance exception to PFIC status by adding a requirement that loss and loss adjustment expenses and certain reserves must generally constitute more than 25% of the company's total assets for the relevant year. By adding an additional \"bright line\" test to the existing PFIC requirements, the Tax Act significantly increases the risk that a non-US insurer will be treated as a PFIC, even if it actively conducts insurance operations. There remain significant uncertainties as to the interpretation of the PFIC active insurance exception given the lack of final IRS regulations. Although the Company intends to structure its assets and operations, as practicable, in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC for 2018, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfy the requirements of the Tax Act.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on May 10, 2018.

Such measures, including net investment income (loss) on float, basic and diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, are referred to as non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Management believes these measures allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying business. These measures are used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP.

Non-U.S. dollar reinsurance assets, or balances held in trust accounts securing reinsurance liabilities generally offset reinsurance liabilities in the same non-U.S. dollar currencies resulting in minimal net exposure. As a result, the foreign exchange losses on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the period are offset by corresponding foreign exchange gains included in net investment income resulting from the revaluation of foreign currency reinsurance collateral held in trust accounts, which is presented as part of the Property and Casualty segment. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company modified the presentation of its operating segment to allocate foreign exchange losses to the Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment to better align with the reinsurance activities that result in these foreign exchange gains and losses. These amounts had previously been presented as part of the Company's corporate function. Prior period segment results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation.\n(2)\nUnderwriting ratios are calculated by dividing the related expense by net premiums earned.\nTHIRD POINT REINSURANCE LTD.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS & KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nNon-GAAP Measures\nBasic Book Value per Share and Diluted Book Value per Share\nBasic book value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures and there are no comparable GAAP measures. Basic book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding, excluding the total number of unvested restricted shares, at period end. Diluted book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents basic book value per share combined with the impact from dilution of all in-the-money share options issued, warrants and unvested restricted shares outstanding as of any period end. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Change in basic book value per share is calculated by taking the change in basic book value per share divided by the beginning of period book value per share. Change in diluted book value per share is calculated by taking the change in diluted book value per share divided by the beginning of period diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows our management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings. In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nBasic and diluted book value per share numerator:\n($ in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nShareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders\n$\n1,607,422\n$\n1,656,089\nEffect of dilutive warrants issued to founders and an advisor\n34,950\n46,512\nEffect of dilutive stock options issued to directors and employees\n51,422\n51,422\nDiluted book value per share numerator\n$\n1,693,794\n$\n1,754,023\nBasic and diluted book value per share denominator:\nCommon shares outstanding\n102,244,248\n103,282,427\nUnvested restricted shares\n(1,992,162)\n(1,873,588)\nBasic book value per share denominator:\n100,252,086\n101,408,839\nEffect of dilutive warrants issued to founders and an advisor\n3,494,979\n4,651,163\nEffect of dilutive stock options issued to directors and employees\n5,123,531\n5,123,531\nEffect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees\n1,155,187\n905,412\nDiluted book value per share denominator\n110,025,783\n112,088,945\nBasic book value per share\n$\n16.03\n$\n16.33\nDiluted book value per share\n$\n15.39\n$\n15.65\nNet Investment Income on Float\nNet investment income on float is an important aspect of our property and casualty reinsurance operation. In an insurance or reinsurance operation, float arises because premiums and proceeds from deposit accounted contracts are collected before losses are paid. In some instances, the interval between receipts and payments can extend over many years. During this time interval, insurance and reinsurance companies invest the premiums received and generate investment returns. We track cash flows generated by our property and casualty reinsurance operations, or float, in separate accounts that allow us to also track the net investment income generated on the float. We believe that net investment income generated on float is an important consideration in evaluating the overall contribution of our property and casualty reinsurance operation to our consolidated results. It is also explicitly considered as part of the evaluation of management's performance for purposes of long-term incentive compensation. Net investment income on float as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the table below for a reconciliation of net investment income on float to net investment income (loss).\n2018\n2017\n($ in thousands)\nNet investment income (loss)\n$\n(2,208)\n$\n128,510\nLess:\nOther investment income (loss)\n(4)\n267\nNet investment income (loss) on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n$\n(2,204)\n$\n128,243\nLess:\nNet investment income (loss) on capital\n(4,803)\n92,123\nNet investment income on float\n$\n2,599\n$\n36,120\nReturn on Beginning Shareholders' Equity Attributable to Third Point Re Common Shareholders\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders. We believe that return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is an important measure because it assists our management and investors in evaluating the Company's profitability. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we have also adjusted the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders for the impact of the shares repurchased on a weighted average basis. For a period where there was a loss, this adjustment decreased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity and for a period where there was a gain, this adjustment increased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity.\n2018\n2017\n($ in thousands)\nNet income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders\n$\n(26,001)\n$\n104,186\nShareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders - beginning of period\n1,656,089\n1,414,051\nImpact of weighting related to shareholders' equity from shares repurchased\n(3,243)\n(5,038)\nAdjusted shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders - beginning of period\n$\n1,652,846\n$\n1,409,013\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders\n(1.6)%\n7.4\n%\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC\nNet investment return represents the return on our investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our investment assets managed by Third Point LLC, net of total noncontrolling interest. The stated return is net of withholding taxes, which are presented as a component of income tax expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.\nInvested Asset Leverage\nInvested asset leverage is a ratio calculated by dividing our net investments managed by Third Point LLC by shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders and is a key metric in assessing the amount of insurance float generated by our reinsurance operation that has been invested by our investment manager, Third Point LLC. Given the sensitivity of our return on beginning shareholders' equity to our net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC, invested asset leverage is an important metric that management monitors. It is also an important metric by which we evaluate our capital adequacy for rating agency and regulatory purposes. Maintaining an appropriate invested asset leverage in order to optimize our return potential, while maintaining sufficient rating agency and regulatory capital is an important aspect of how we manage the Company. We target an invested asset leverage ratio within a range of approximately 1.5 to 1.6, which we believe appropriately balances our return potential against the risk within our investment portfolio.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-reports-first-quarter-2018-earnings-results-300645878.html\nSOURCE Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-reports-first-quarter-2018-earnings-results-300645878.html", "http://www.thirdpointre.bm/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T00:52:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
