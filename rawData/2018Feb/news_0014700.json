What makes me exceedingly proud is how we responded to several curveballs thrown our way. Instead of allowing these challenges to limit us, we turned them into opportunities that ultimately defined our year.\"\n\"Despite the challenges presented by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter, our impacted markets rebounded much quicker than initially thought on the active production units and other areas of the company over-performed resulting in us ending the year at the mid-point of our pre-hurricane closings guidance,\" continued Palmer. \"In fact, we met or exceeded most points of our initial 2017 guidance as well as our increased guidance after the second quarter.\"\nFor the full year 2017, Taylor Morrison closed 8,032 homes, a 9 percent year-over-year increase. The full year 2017 sales pace was 2.4, a 20 percent increase compared to 2016. Taylor Morrison ended the year with 3,496 units in backlog, a year-over-year increase of 12 percent, setting up the company well for the start of 2018. That momentum has carried into the company's strongest January yet with a pace of 2.5 that accelerated throughout the month. That pace compares to 2.3 in January 2017, almost a 10 percent increase on top of a nearly 24 percent increase last year.\n\"Our financial results for 2017 were tremendous and I'm equally pleased with two awards we received that illustrate what it means to work at Taylor Morrison,\" said Palmer. \"First we were honored with a Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award recognizing the Best Places to Work in 2018. The award program relies solely on the input of employees, a testament to the positive, career-affirming culture we've created. More recently we were named America's Most Trusted® Homebuilder by Lifestory Research for an unprecedented third year in a row. Earning these awards so closely together is fitting because I believe the former begets the latter. Investing in our culture and team members motivates them to deliver best-in-class customer service which leads to great operational and financial performance.\"\nHome closings gross margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, was 19.0 percent for the fourth quarter, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth as well as a 120 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2017 the company's home closings gross margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, was 18.6 percent, representing a year-over-year increase of 40 basis points.\n\"The newly passed tax reform created two specific charges for us in the fourth quarter,\" said Dave Cone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"The first was a $57.4 million non-cash charge related to our deferred tax assets to value them at the new lower corporate tax rate. Second, we also took a $3.6 million charge for the mandatory deemed repatriation of proceeds related to the sale of our Canadian business in 2015. As a result of the tax reform impact, our reported effective tax rate for 2017 was 50.3 percent. Excluding such impact, we finished 2017 with an effective tax rate of 33.2 percent. Moving forward, we anticipate a lower 2018 effective tax rate which we expect will create additional investment opportunities for us.\"\nThe Company ended the year with total liquidity of just over $1 billion including $574 million in cash and a net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio of 25.8 percent.\nHomebuilding inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the 2017, including 4,351 homes in inventory, compared to 3,920 homes in inventory at the end of the prior year. Homes in inventory at the end of the 2017 consisted of 2,528 sold units, 390 model homes and 1,433 inventory units, of which 222 were finished. The Company owned or controlled approximately 38,000 lots at December 31, 2017, representing 4.7 years of supply, and is focused on securing land for 2019 and beyond.\nQuarterly Financial Comparison\n($ thousands)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nTotal Revenue\n$1,299,679\n$1,196,967\n8.6\n%\nHome Closings Revenue\n$1,272,231\n$1,154,367\n10.2\n%\nHome Closings Gross Margin\n$241,964\n$205,352\n17.8\n%\n19.0\n%\n17.8\n%\n120 bps increase\nSG&A\n$111,435\n$105,385\n5.7\n%\n% of Home Closings Revenue\n8.8\n%\n9.1\n%\n30 bps leverage\nAnnual Financial Comparison\n($ thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017 vs. 2016\nTotal Revenue\n$3,885,290\n$3,550,029\n9.4\n%\nHome Closings Revenue\n$3,799,061\n$3,425,521\n10.9\n%\nHome Closings Gross Margin\n$706,357\n$623,782\n13.2\n%\n18.6\n%\n18.2\n%\n40 bps increase\nSG&A\n$390,440\n$361,763\n7.9\n%\n% of Home Closings Revenue\n10.3\n%\n10.6\n%\n30 bps leverage\nFirst Quarter and Full Year 2018 Business Outlook\nFirst Quarter 2018:\nAverage active community count is expected to be between 285 to 290 Home closings are expected to be between 1,550 to 1,650 Home closings margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, is expected to be accretive to 2017 and be in the mid 18% range\nFull Year 2018:\nAverage active community count is expected to be flat to 2017 Monthly absorption pace is expected to be between 2.4 to 2.5 per outlet on average Home closings are expected to be between 8,400 to 8,800 Home closings gross margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, is expected to be accretive to 2017 and be in the mid to high 18% range SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenue is expected to be in the low 10% range Income from unconsolidated joint ventures is expected to be between $8 million to $10 million Land and development spend is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion Effective tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27% Diluted share count is expected to be about 114 million\nOperating Division Realignment Within Our Segments\nAs of March 31, 2017 we realigned our homebuilding operating divisions within our existing segments based on geographic location and management's long-term strategic plans.

Adjusted income tax provision and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect our income tax provision adjusted to exclude the impact of the reevaluation of our deferred tax assets and the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings, both of which resulted from the tax reform legislation (the \"tax reform adjustments\"). Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect our adjusted net income from continuing operations to exclude the tax reform adjustments. Net homebuilding debt to capitalization is a non-GAAP financial measure we calculate by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity).\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis, as well as the performance of our regions, and to set targets for performance-based compensation. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. In the future, we may include additional adjustments in the above described non-GAAP financial measures to the extent we deem them appropriate and useful to management and investors.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it allows investors to evaluate our performance without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Adjusted EBITDA also provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, or non-recurring items. We also believe that presenting our adjusted income tax provision, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share is useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the impact of the tax reform adjustments. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of our operating performance or liquidity. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry may report similar information, their definitions may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures before comparing their measures to ours.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n$\n30,426\n$\n76,111\nInterest income, net\n(263)\n(35)\nAmortization of capitalized interest\n29,493\n30,819\nIncome tax provision\n113,375\n40,945\nDepreciation and amortization\n960\n972\nEBITDA\n$\n173,991\n$\n148,812\nNon-cash compensation expense\n1,359\n1,954\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n175,350\n$\n150,766\nAdjusted Income Tax Provision Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIncome tax provision\n$\n113,375\n$\n40,945\n$\n179,006\n$\n107,643\nTax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities\n$\n(57,425)\n$\n(57,425)\nTax reform impact due to the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings\n$\n(3,553)\n$\n—\n$\n(3,553)\n$\n—\nAdjusted income tax provision excluding tax reform\n$\n52,397\n$\n40,945\n$\n118,028\n$\n107,643\nAdjusted effective tax rate\n36.4\n%\n35.0\n%\n33.2\n%\n34.3\n%\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n$\n30,426\n$\n76,111\n$\n176,650\n$\n206,563\nTax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities\n$\n57,425\n$\n57,425\nTax reform impact due to the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings\n$\n3,553\n$\n—\n$\n3,553\n$\n—\nAdjusted net income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n$\n91,404\n$\n76,111\n$\n237,628\n$\n206,563\nNet loss/(income) attributable to non-controlling interests - joint ventures\n$\n195\n$\n(438)\n$\n(430)\n$\n(1,294)\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interest - Principal Equityholders\n$\n32,010\n$\n56,392\n$\n114,341\n$\n152,653\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations - basic\n$\n59,589\n$\n19,281\n$\n122,857\n$\n52,616\nLoss fully attributable to public holding company (1)\n$\n2,840\n$\n20\n$\n3,128\n$\n211\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations - diluted\n$\n94,439\n$\n75,693\n$\n240,326\n$\n205,480\nWeighted average number of shares of common stock:\nBasic\n77,696\n30,442\n62,061\n31,084\nDiluted\n121,099\n120,392\n120,915\n120,832\nAdjusted earnings per common share — basic:\n$\n0.77\n$\n0.63\n$\n1.98\n$\n1.69\nAdjusted earnings per common share — diluted:\n$\n0.77\n$\n0.63\n$\n1.98\n$\n1.69\n(1) 2017 amounts primarily represent U.S. tax expense from the public company's indirect ownership of a Canadian subsidiary which is a controlled foreign corporation.\nNet Homebuilding Debt to Capitalization Ratio Reconciliation\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2017\nTotal debt\n$\n1,498,062\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n10,213\nLess mortgage warehouse borrowings\n118,822\nTotal homebuilding debt\n$\n1,389,453\nLess cash and cash equivalents\n573,925\nNet homebuilding debt\n$\n815,528\nTotal equity\n2,346,545\nTotal capitalization\n$\n3,162,073\nNet homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio\n25.8\n%\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taylor-morrison-reports-fiscal-year-2017-closings-of-8032-an-increase-of-9-and-earnings-per-share-of-147-or-198-when-adjusted-to-exclude-the-impact-of-tax-reform-charges-in-the-fourth-quarter-300594614.html\nSOURCE Taylor Morrison", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taylor-morrison-reports-fiscal-year-2017-closings-of-8032-an-increase-of-9-and-earnings-per-share-of-147-or-198-when-adjusted-to-exclude-the-impact-of-tax-reform-charges-in-the-fourth-quarter-300594614.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T18:31:57.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
