In a nutshell, beware UK companies which offer attractive yields but don't necessarily have the balance sheet to back them up when profit warnings hit the screens. The French bank has a \"dividend risk screen\" and says \"several UK names that have recently got into trouble were on this list\". \"Of the current 50 names, 21 are UK-listed, close to historical highs\", SocGen analysts add. Capita, by the way, was on that list prior to its profit warning: (Julien Ponthus) A TOUGH START FOR EUROPE'S NON-FOOD RETAILERS (1316 GMT) It's evident from the results we've had so far from the European non-food retailers that certain themes are gaining favour with investors, such as progress in online and a more value-oriented offering. Analysts at Deutsche Bank point to \"another month of polarisation\", and they highlight five key investment themes in the space: 1) Buy the value retailers; 2) Watch value traps in mid-market apparel retail; 3) Online brands over platforms; 4) Remain cautious about 'transformation stories'; 5) Buy travel at right price. Here's how the non-food retailers of the STOXX 600 have performed so far this year - it's been a tricky start for some: (Kit Rees) \"DEATH, TAXES AND BEAR MARKETS\" (1232 GMT) \"There are three certainties in life: death, taxes and bear markets\", says Peter Elston, CIO of Seneca Investment Managers. Timing, of course, makes all the difference and Elston, whose firm has already lowered equity weights, sees a bear market coming in late 2019. According to Seneca's research, a gradual tightening of monetary policy will cause a downturn in the global economy in 2020. Even if things don't exactly unfold at that pace, Elston argues there is a case to act now. \"We will almost certainly be wrong with our timing but this is why we are acting now. If we are late, we will have already reduced equity exposure. If we are early, and the bull market continues into 2020, we can continue to reduce our equity targets even more.\" (Julien Ponthus) WHAT WOULD A MEGA ITALIAN BANK MERGER LOOK LIKE? (1150 GMT) \"Consolidation is the only survival strategy,\" says Equita analyst Giovanni Razzoli in a study this week where he simulates the unthinkable: a mega Italian bank tie-up sponsored by the government and combining state-controlled Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Banco BPM , BPER Banca, Credito Valtellinese and Banca Carige to create the country's largest franchise. Razzoli calls the five-bank combination \"project Overlord\" and assumes that Italy's Ministry of Economy and Finances which controls Monte Paschi would sponsor it. He's aware of the risks but sees rich rewards too. \"We are perfectly aware that a 'project Overlord' would feature very high execution risk, and – above all - several governance issues. The project is likely to 'scandalize' most of the shareholders of the banks potentially involved,\" he writes. He envisages a two-step process. The banks involved would first put together the main administrative and governance functions in exchange for shares in a new holding company at market prices. Secondly they would move to a deeper integration and look at the cost-cutting options. The new bank would be the leader in Italy with a capitalisation of 12 billion euros before synergies and a 20 percent market share of the Italian banking system, leapfrogging Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit. (Danilo Masoni) TACTICAL INDICATORS FLASHING RED? DON'T PANIC (1110 GMT) Credit Suisse's aggregate tactical indicator hit its highest level of exuberance in the last 12 years late last week, the bank's global equity strategists say, but they don't interpret this as a sell signal. \"Both the aggregate tactical and sentiment signals have been much better buy than sell signals: euphoria lasts longer than panic!\" writes strategist Andrew Garthwaite. According to Garthwaite, only two of the normal 13 preconditions of a market peak have been seen - so remaining positive on stocks despite their strong rally isn't irrational. \"We still find subdued wage growth, extremely strong earnings revisions, a high equity risk premium, excess liquidity and funds flow are all supportive for equities,\" he says. Interestingly cyclicals (apart from tech and financials) are however a risk area Garthwaite is nervous about, saying these stocks have priced themselves off extreme PMIs/ISMs. (Helen Reid) THE UK IS THE LAGGARD IN 2018 (SO FAR) (1050 GMT) Just a quick observation as we step into a new month - the UK equity market has notably lagged the rest of the world in terms of total returns so far this year - see the chart below. Conversely, emerging markets and Europe (ex-UK) are shaping up to be this year's winners. It is early days yet, but investors could be betting on these two regions as big beneficiaries of the synchronised upswing in global growth, whereas investors are still nervous around the UK? (Kit Rees) VIEW FROM THE STREET: THE CASE FOR NOT BUYING THE DIP IN CAPITA (1043 GMT) After a 48 percent fall yesterday, brokers are digesting UK outsourcer Capita's latest profit warning and outlining the possibilities for its future. Down another 4 percent today to 177p the stock is certainly cheap - but why are bargain-hunters not snapping it up? \"Too early to buy back in despite the fall,\" say Deutsche Bank analysts. \"Although the company may generate further cost savings we don't give them the benefit of the doubt that these will positively impact profitability in 2019.\" They don't see Capita showing growing profitability until 2020 at the earliest - a date UBS also targets as a potential recovery point. \"We think a (required) focus on internal execution will see negative earnings growth and free cash flow for FY18e and FY19e, but FY20e could see both turn positive,\" write UBS analysts. Barclays says Capita is a five-year turnaround story which must also grapple with \"profound change and uncertainty\" in its markets. \"This is a first and necessary step on the road to recovery, but the lack of visibility coupled with experience at Serco (where three years on the recovery in revenue and profits is still elusive) will likely keep new money on the sidelines for a while yet,\" Barclays analysts write. (Helen Reid) BINGE-BUYING EUROPACORP SHARES, NETFLIX AND NO CHILL (1003 GMT) Shares in French film director Luc Besson's EuropaCorp are on fire this morning, up as much as 40 percent after French business daily Les Echos reported Netflix is in talks - not clear at this stage exactly about what - with the company which made a hit with \"Lucy\", staring Scarlett Johansson, in 2014. After a box office disappointment for its big budget sci-fi movie \"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\" this summer, EuropaCorp has been on the look-out for new partners to bring in fresh cash or help it restructure its debt. EuropaCorp is worth currently a bit less than 100 million euros on the Paris stock market, that's a market cap about 1000 times smaller than Netflix, which plans to spend up to $8 billion this year on TV shows and movies to fend off rivals such as Amazon Prime. Here's Luc Besson and the logo of his company in the background. (Julien Ponthus) OPENING SNAPSHOT: TOP MOVERS (0817 GMT) Return of the melt-up? European stocks are striding into February with strong gains led by banking and tech stocks. Among notable movers after results, Bic is down 6.7 percent while NEX Group is top of the STOXX, up 7.4 percent after revenues rose. The financial technology firm benefited from markets it said were 'noticeably' more active this year. Meanwhile Shell took a 5 percent dive at the open and is now down 1.8 percent, the worst-performing on the FTSE 100. It seems the cashflow might be what the market's taking issue with. \"Unfortunately, resilient earnings do not appear to have translated into cash generation this quarter,\" write RBC analysts. Dealmaking is still a feature too with Denmark's TDC tumbling 10.7 percent after saying it would buy Swedish Modern Times Group's broadcasting and entertainment business. (Helen Reid) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0748 GMT) European shares are expected to open higher on the first day of February with futures up around 0.4-0.5 percent following a weak end of January, which was marked by jitters over rising bond yields and a stronger euro. Earnings will be a key focus with heavyweights such as oil major Royal Dutch Shell and drugmaker Roche having already reported results. Profits at Shell more than doubled, slightly beating analyst expectations, although traders indicated the stock 1-2 percent lower citing weak cash flow. Net income at Roche fell as sales growth was broadly in line with expectations. Consumer goods maker Unilever delivered better than expected fourth-quarter sales growth, a possible relief for a sector which has been hit this year by a rotation back into cyclical stocks. Its shares were indicated 1 percent higher. Overall fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to increase by 11.9 percent year on year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed. In M&A news, traders mentioned as possibly market-moving a Bloomberg report saying BHP is mulling a split of its US shale unit to speed up the sale of the business it values at $10 billion. (Danilo Masoni) EUROPEAN STOCKS HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0733 GMT) With so many results coming in today, we've rounded up some of the most important we're watching: Shell's 2017 profits more than double Unilever fourth-quarter sales better than expected Daimler warns spending on new technology to dampen earnings growth Vodafone's growth edges lower in Europe, but still on track for year Nokia top quarterly expectations, buoyed by patent payment Roche expects 2018 profit to grow faster than sales[ BT's Openreach ramps up fibre broadband rollout Microsoft's cloud computing business grows, stock edges up Facebook forecasts rising ad sales despite dip in usage Novo Nordisk posts Q4 results slightly below expectations, chairman to step down BBVA Q4 net profit falls 90 pct after Telefonica stake writedown Denmark's TDC to buy MTG's Nordic Entertainment and Studios Denmark's Orsted beats Q4 forecasts on strong wind operations DNB Q4 beats forecast despite rise in digital investment Dassault Systemes posts double-digit growth in new licences revenue Lundin Petroleum launches dividend payments Skanska construction order intake just lags expectations UK's Rank interim profit jumps on strong online business Vivendi CEO optimistic about talks with Mediaset over pay-TV dispute Oreo maker Mondelez's profit beats on higher demand for key brands Melrose to publish formal bid document for GKN on Thursday - source Britain's Cranswick says Q3 revenue ahead on strong Christmas NEX Group says markets \"noticeably\" more active since start of 2018 British private equity group 3i posts increase in net asset value per share Ocado promotes Luke Jensen to executive director role​ (Tom Pfeiffer) FUTURES POINT TO BOUNCEBACK FOR EUROPEAN STOCKS (0717 GMT) Futures have opened markedly higher this morning, pointing to a convincing bounceback for the European stock market after a weak end to January. As we pointed out earlier, it's all about earnings today, and UK companies' results have just hit the wire with heavyweights Unilever and Shell reporting as well as Vodafone. (Helen Reid) EARNINGS, EARNINGS, EARNINGS (0642 GMT) It's going to be another busy day for corporate eanings with some big heavyweights like drugmaker Roche, bank BBVA and Nokia having already released their numbers earlier on. Overall fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to increase by 11.9 percent year on year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed.
