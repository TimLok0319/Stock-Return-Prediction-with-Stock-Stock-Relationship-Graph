(\"Extreme\") (Nasdaq: EXTR) today released financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond Quarter Results:\nSecond quarter revenue was $231.1 million, an increase of 48% year-over-year. GAAP gross margin for the second fiscal quarter was 55.8%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.4% year-over-year, an increase of 220 basis points year-over-year. GAAP operating margin for the second fiscal quarter was (13.5)% and non-GAAP operating margin was 8.8%, compared to (1.9)% and 11.7 %, respectively, year-over-year.

Non-GAAP net income was $16.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.7 million and $0.02, respectively, year-over-year.\n\"We delivered solid performance in the second fiscal quarter highlighted by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and solid execution of our integration initiatives associated with our newly acquired assets,\" stated Ed Meyercord, President and CEO of Extreme Networks.\n\"I am especially pleased with our non-GAAP gross margin performance in the quarter, which is close to exceeding our near-term goal of 60%,\" continued Meyercord. \"We turned away a significant volume of low margin business this quarter in favor of higher quality, solutions-driven sales that drove our non-GAAP gross margin improvement for the twelfth consecutive quarter. We expect to see continued improvement in gross margins in the second half of our fiscal year in addition to significant sequential quarterly growth.\"\n\"Our recent acquisitions have meaningfully strengthened our brand, our competitive position and our technology differentiation in the market. We are seeing significant growth in our pipeline, which includes many cross-selling opportunities. Our March quarter will be the first quarter of fully consolidated operations and we expect to deliver year-over-year organic growth in our core Extreme business, meeting or exceeding our annual target of $430 million of newly acquired revenue which is evident in our guidance,\" Meyercord added.\nFinally, Meyercord added, \"We successfully completed the migration of the data and IT systems of the acquired assets from Brocade into Extreme as planned on January 15th and we are on track to migrate the data and systems of the Avaya assets in early April. Our teams have done an outstanding job driving our business while managing these large and complex integration initiatives.\"\nRecent Key Events :\nSt John's Hotel is a luxury hotel with 1,091 guest rooms located in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the host city for the 2018 Winter Olympics.

GAAP gross margin is targeted between 56.1% and 58.4% and non-GAAP gross margin is targeted between 58.9% and 61.1%.

The Company is providing with this press release non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. In preparing non-GAAP information, the Company has excluded, where applicable, the impact of share-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, acquired inventory adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, litigation expenses, other income and income tax. The Company believes that excluding these items provides both management and investors with additional insight into its current operations, the trends affecting the Company, the Company's marketplace performance, and the Company's ability to generate cash from operations. Please note the Company's non-GAAP measures may be different than those used by other companies.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and free cash flow.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all historical non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included with this press release. In this press release, Extreme Networks also presents its target for non-GAAP expenses, which is expenses less share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, acquired inventory adjustments, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, litigation, amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, executive transition expenses, litigation expenses, other income and income tax.\nNon-GAAP measures presented in this press release are not in accordance with or alternative measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Extreme Networks' results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate Extreme Networks' results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nExtreme believes these non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures to enhance investors' and management's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future, including cash flows available to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. In addition, because Extreme Networks has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the Company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal planning process, and as discussed further below, Extreme's management uses financial statements that do not include share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, acquired inventory adjustment, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, litigation, other income and income tax. Extreme's management also uses non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the Company's financial results.\nAs described above, Extreme excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable.\nShare-based compensation . This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases through its ESPP. Extreme Networks excludes share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing cash requirement related to operating results. Extreme Networks expects to incur share-based compensation expenses in future periods.\nAcquisition and integration costs. Acquisition and integration costs consist of legal and professional fees related to the acquisition of a) Zebra Technologies Corporation's wireless LAN business b) Avaya, Inc.'s Campus Fabric business, and c) Brocade's Data Center assets; Extreme Networks excludes these expenses since they result from an event that is outside the ordinary course of continuing operations.\nPurchase accounting adjustments . Purchase accounting adjustments relating to deferred revenue consists of adjustments to the carrying value of deferred revenue. We have recorded adjustments to the assumed deferred revenue to reflect only a fulfillment margin and thereby excluding the profit margin and revenue which would have been incurred had Extreme Networks entered into the service contract post-acquisition.\nAcquired inventory adjustments . Purchase accounting adjustments relating to the mark up of acquired inventory to fair value less disposal costs.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles. Amortization of acquired intangibles includes the monthly amortization expense of acquired intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks and order backlog. The amortization of the developed technology intangible is recorded in product cost of goods sold, while the amortization for the other intangibles are recorded in operating expenses. Extreme Networks excludes these non-cash expenses since they result from an intangible asset and for which the period expense does not impact the operations of the business and are non-cash in nature.\nRestructuring expenses . Restructuring expenses primarily consist of accrued lease costs pertaining to the estimated future obligations for non-cancelable lease payments and accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements related to excess facilities. Extreme Networks excludes restructuring expenses since they result from events that often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations.\nExecutive transition expenses. Executive transition expenses consists of severance and termination benefits and legal transition cash transactions. The expenses are incurred through execution of pre-established employment contracts with senior executives.\nLitigation expenses . Litigation expenses consist of legal and professional fees and expenses related to our on-going ligation matter.\nOther income . Other income consists of the gain on the sale of our equity investment in a private company.\nIncome tax . Income tax adjustments relate to the tax impact of reducing the US tax rate applied to deferred tax items pursuant to the recently enacted US tax legislation as well as the tax benefit resulting from the impairment of a lease acquired from Avaya in Canada.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, Extreme uses free cash flow as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchase of property and equipment on a GAAP basis. Extreme considers free cash flows to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in Extreme's business, make strategic acquisitions, and strengthen the balance sheet. A limitation of the utility of free cash flows as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the Company's cash balance for the period.\nEXTREME NETWORKS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n(In thousands, except percentages and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nRevenue - GAAP Basis\n$\n231,123\n$\n156,377\n$\n442,838\n$\n278,981\nAdjustments:\nPurchase accounting adjustment\n—\n—\n—\n133\nRevenue - Non-GAAP Basis\n$\n231,123\n$\n156,377\n$\n442,838\n$\n279,114\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nGross profit - GAAP Basis\n$\n128,986\n$\n79,652\n$\n241,367\n$\n145,538\nGross margin - GAAP Basis percentage\n55.8%\n50.9%\n54.5%\n52.2%\nAdjustments:\nStock based compensation expense\n430\n308\n655\n608\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n133\nAcquired inventory adjustments\n1,249\n2,300\n4,187\n2,300\nAcquisition and integration costs\n2,672\n5,517\n4,518\n5,517\nAmortization of intangibles\n3,964\n1,719\n6,528\n5,136\nTotal adjustments to GAAP gross profit\n$\n8,315\n$\n9,844\n$\n15,888\n$\n13,694\nGross profit - Non-GAAP\n$\n137,301\n$\n89,496\n$\n257,255\n$\n159,232\nGross margin - Non-GAAP percentage\n59.4%\n57.2%\n58.1%\n57.0%\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nGAAP operating income (loss)\n$\n(31,110)\n$\n(2,980)\n$\n(26,618)\n$\n(7,002)\nGAAP operating income (loss) percentage\n(13.5)%\n(1.9)%\n(6.0)%\n(2.5)%\nAdjustments:\nStock based compensation expense\n7,025\n3,381\n11,828\n6,856\nAcquisition and integration costs, net of bargain purchase gain\n36,787\n9,686\n42,877\n12,007\nRestructuring charge, net of reversal\n—\n1,853\n—\n1,853\nAcquired inventory adjustments\n1,249\n2,300\n4,187\n2,300\nAmortization of intangibles\n6,710\n3,894\n10,888\n11,453\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n133\nExecutive transition costs\n—\n—\n—\n34\nLitigation\n(365)\n236\n(365)\n263\nTotal adjustments to GAAP operating income\n$\n51,406\n$\n21,350\n$\n69,415\n$\n34,899\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n20,296\n$\n18,370\n$\n42,797\n$\n27,897\nNon-GAAP operating income percentage\n8.8%\n11.7%\n9.7%\n10.0%\nNon-GAAP Net Income\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(31,923)\n$\n(4,229)\n$\n(27,547)\n$\n(9,971)\nAdjustments:\nStock based compensation expense\n7,025\n3,381\n11,828\n6,856\nAcquisition and integration costs, net of bargain purchase gain\n36,787\n9,686\n42,877\n12,007\nRestructuring charge, net of reversal\n—\n1,853\n—\n1,853\nAcquired inventory adjustments\n1,249\n2,300\n4,187\n2,300\nAmortization of intangibles\n6,710\n3,894\n10,888\n11,453\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n133\nExecutive transition costs\n—\n—\n—\n34\nLitigation\n(365)\n236\n(365)\n263\nGain on sale of non-marketable equity investment\n—\n—\n(3,757)\n—\nIncome tax\n(3,102)\n—\n(3,102)\n—\nTotal adjustments to GAAP net loss\n$\n48,304\n$\n21,350\n$\n62,556\n$\n34,899\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n16,381\n$\n17,121\n$\n35,009\n$\n24,928\nEarnings per share\nNon-GAAP net income per share-diluted\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.16\n$\n0.29\n$\n0.23\nShares used in net income per share-diluted\nNon-GAAP shares used\n119,646\n110,152\n119,038\n109,394\nFree Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nCash flow (used in) provided by operations\n$\n(4,350)\n$\n9,714\n$\n14,248\n$\n19,288\nLess: PP&E CapEx spending\n(5,888)\n(3,027)\n(13,309)\n(4,662)\nTotal free cash flow\n$\n(10,238)\n$\n6,687\n$\n939\n$\n14,626\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/extreme-networks-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-financial-results-300594535.html\nSOURCE Extreme Networks, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.extremenetworks.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/extreme-networks-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-financial-results-300594535.html", "http://investor.extremenetworks.com/"], "published": "2018-02-07T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T01:04:44.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
