Consolidated revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $83.1 million compared to $71.6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $82.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, compression services revenues increased 3.3%, reflecting increases in fleet utilization. Equipment sales increased by $8.5 million from the third quarter to $18.9 million. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $10.7 million compared to a $7.8 million loss for the third quarter of 2017 and $12.1 million loss for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelected key operational and financial metrics are as follows:\nOrders for new equipment sales in the fourth quarter were $16.7 million. In early January, CSI Compressco received a $67 million order for large horsepower equipment to be fabricated for a midstream operator in the Permian Basin. This equipment is expected to ship during the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019. Backlog for equipment sales was $47.5 million as of December 31, 2017. With the January order, backlog increased in January to approximately $117 million. Overall service fleet utilization increased 180 basis points (bps) compared to the end of the third quarter, to 83.2%. Utilization for large horsepower equipment, greater than 800 hp per unit, increased to 92.3%, up 220 bps sequentially. Distributable cash flow (1) for the quarter was $5.4 million, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 0.73X Maintenance capital expenditures were $6.9 million as additional previously idle equipment was made ready for deployment to address the strong demand for field gathering and gas lift. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $21.0 million, compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter, as the third quarter included a non-recurring gain of $3.0 million from insurance proceeds.\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the nearest GAAP number on Schedules A, B, and C\nAs of December 31, 2017, aggregate compression services fleet horsepower totaled 1,081,919 horsepower and the fleet utilization rate was 83.2%. Utilization of our highest horsepower category, equipment of greater than 800 horsepower per unit, was 92.3% at the end of the quarter. We define the fleet utilization rate as the aggregate compressor package horsepower in service divided by the aggregate compressor package fleet horsepower as of a given date. We do not exclude idle horsepower under repair or horsepower that is otherwise impaired from our calculation of utilization rate.\nUnaudited results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior quarter and the corresponding prior year quarter are presented in the accompanying financial tables.\nThree Months Ended\nDec 31, 2017\nSep 30, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nQ4-17 vs.\nQ3-17\nQ4-17 vs.\nQ4-16\n(In Thousands, Except Ratios, Per Unit Amounts and Percentages)\nNet loss\n$ (10,673)\n$ (7,821)\n$ (12,138)\n(36)%\n12%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$ 21,022\n$ 23,341\n$ 21,682\n(10)%\n(3)%\nDistributable cash flow (1)\n$ 5,368\n$ 10,778\n$ 8,798\n(50)%\n(39)%\nQuarterly cash distribution per unit\n$ 0.1875\n$ 0.1875\n$ 0.3775\n—\n—\nDistribution coverage ratio (1)\n0.73x\n1.56x\n0.68x\n—\n—\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 14,496\n$ 13,218\n$ 15,922\n10 %\n(9)%\nFree cash flow (1)\n$ 3,083\n$ 10,982\n$ 12,865\n(72)%\n(76)%\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the nearest GAAP number on Schedules B and C.\nOwen Serjeant, President of CSI Compressco, commented, \"The compression market is in the midst of a robust recovery. In the fall of 2017, we experienced an increasing demand for large horsepower equipment to address gathering system requirements, particularly throughout the West Texas, South Texas and the Oklahoma SCOOP/Stack markets as the rig count climbed to over 900 active rigs. The latest demand is now coming for mid- to large horsepower equipment services as the industry is moving to centralized surface gas lift as initial production rates on new wells are not as strong as they were earlier in 2017. With the migration toward pad drilling and tighter well spacing, combined with large volumes of associated gas, operators have started moving toward centralized gas lift using larger horsepower compression equipment to perform surface lift simultaneously on multiple wells.\"\n\"In addition to the stronger demand for gathering systems equipment based on incremental infield drilling and stronger Delaware Basin activity, plus increased surface gas lift requirements, we are seeing an increase in the request for pricing and proposals to fabricate and deliver larger horsepower equipment. In the fourth quarter, we received orders for $16.7 million of new equipment to be delivered in 2017. In early January, 2018, we received a $67 million order to deliver 45 new large horsepower units to a midstream operator in West Texas. This recent order is the largest in the history of CSI and Compressco and is scheduled for delivery in the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019. Customers are recognizing that the drilling program schedules into 2019 will require more horsepower to enhance production, compress and move associated gas through the gathering systems and build or expand gas processing facilities. We are also seeing increasing demand to build and deploy equipment in Latin America, primarily in Mexico and Argentina.\"\nThe increased activity has pushed utilization of our large horsepower services equipment to more than 92%. We are now also experiencing strong demand for equipment in the 101-800 horsepower range to address the gas lift opportunities. As a result of this stronger demand and higher utilization levels, we are starting to push pricing higher to recover discounts conceded during the downturn of the past three years. Maintenance capital expenditures increased in the fourth quarter as the stronger demand is requiring us to make ready equipment that had been idle for longer periods of time. We are also preparing for deployment more of the GasJack and VJack service fleet to areas including the Rockies and the Permian Basin.\nThis uptick in demand is also driving increases in aftermarket services (AMS) as customers are catching up on maintenance and deploying previously idle equipment. 2017 AMS orders increased 76% year over year. We entered 2018 with $10.5 million in AMS backlog.\nForward-Looking Guidance\nProjected 2018 total capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $75 million. Maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be between $15 million and $20 million. We expect to fund these capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash flow, as well as borrowings under our credit facility, which we expect to extend or replace during 2018. Capital market sources may also be utilized depending on market conditions. We believe a combination of these sources should position us to invest growth capital to take advantage of the recovery occurring in multiple areas of our operations.\nConference Call\nCSI Compressco will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results today, February 27, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The phone number for the call is 1-866-374-8397.

Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by the Partnership's management to:\nassess the Partnership's ability to generate available cash sufficient to make distributions to the Partnership's unitholders and general partner; evaluate the financial performance of its assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; measure operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of our competitors; determine the Partnership's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and monitor the financial performance measure used in the Partnership's bank credit facility financial covenant.\nThe Partnership defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and before certain non-cash charges consisting of impairments, bad debt expense attributable to bankruptcy of customer, non-cash costs of compressors sold, equity compensation, fair value adjustments of our Preferred Units, administrative expenses under the Omnibus Agreement paid in equity using common units, severance expense, and software implementation expense.\nDistributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by the Partnership's management, as it provides important information relating to the relationship between our financial operating performance and our cash distribution capability. Additionally, the Partnership uses distributable cash flow in setting forward expectations and in communications with the board of directors of our general partner. The Partnership defines distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less current income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures, interest expense, and severance expense, plus non-cash interest expense.\nThe Partnership believes that the distribution coverage ratio provides important information relating to the relationship between the Partnership's financial operating performance and its cash distribution capability. The Partnership defines the distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total quarterly distribution payable, which includes, as applicable, distributions payable on all outstanding common units, the general partner interest and the general partner's incentive distribution rights.\nThe Partnership defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, net of sales proceeds. Management primarily uses this metric to assess our ability to retire debt, evaluate our capacity to further invest and grow, and measure our performance as compared to our peer group of companies.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, free cash flow or other similarly titled measures of other entities, as other entities may not calculate these non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as CSI Compressco. Management compensates for the limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating this knowledge into management's decision making process. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that CSI Compressco has available for distributions or that the Partnership plans to distribute for a given period, nor should they be equated to available cash as defined in the Partnership's partnership agreement.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio for the three month periods ended December 31 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nSchedule B - Reconciliation of Net Income/(Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDec 31, 2017\nSep 30, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\n(In Thousands)\nNet loss\n$ (10,673)\n$ (7,821)\n$ (12,138)\n$ (40,459)\n$ (138,138)\nInterest expense, net\n11,232\n11,071\n10,621\n43,135\n38,055\nProvision for income taxes\n593\n772\n368\n2,784\n1,865\nDepreciation and amortization\n17,280\n17,361\n17,107\n69,140\n72,123\nImpairments of long-lived assets\n—\n—\n2,357\n—\n10,223\nGoodwill Impairment\n—\n—\n—\n—\n92,334\nBad debt expense attributable to bankruptcy of customer\n—\n—\n—\n—\n728\nNon-cash cost of compressors sold\n1,768\n2,406\n3,941\n8,505\n6,772\nEquity Compensation\n(933)\n261\n792\n1,219\n3,028\nSeries A Preferred transaction costs\n—\n—\n85\n37\n3,131\nSeries A Preferred fair value adjustments\n1,561\n(1,300)\n(2,162)\n(3,402)\n5,036\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n(865)\n—\n(1,405)\nOmnibus expense paid in equity\n—\n—\n1,576\n1,746\n1,576\nSeverance\n—\n8\n—\n63\n562\nSoftware implementation\n195\n583\n—\n974\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n21,022\n23,341\n21,682\n83,742\n95,890\nLess:\nCurrent income tax expense\n311\n545\n608\n2,027\n1,835\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n6,936\n3,841\n4,840\n21,055\n11,359\nInterest Expense, net\n11,232\n11,071\n10,621\n43,135\n38,055\nSeverance\n—\n8\n—\n63\n562\nPlus:\nNon-cash items included in interest expense\n2,825\n2,902\n3,185\n11,546\n6,873\nDistributable cash flow\n5,368\n10,778\n8,798\n29,008\n50,952\nCash distribution attributable to period\n7,389\n6,916\n12,870\n27,582\n51,237\nDistribution coverage ratio\n0.73x\n1.56x\n0.68x\n1.05x\n0.99x\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three month periods ended December 31 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31 2016, and the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nSchedule C - Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\nResults of Operations (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDec 31, 2017\nSep 30, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\n(In Thousands)\nCash from operations\n$ 14,496\n$ 13,218\n$ 15,922\n$ 39,068\n$ 61,444\nCapital expenditures, net of sales proceeds\n(11,413)\n(2,236)\n(3,057)\n(25,126)\n(10,659)\nFree cash flow\n$ 3,083\n$ 10,982\n$ 12,865\n$ 13,942\n$ 50,785\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/csi-compressco-lp-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604611.html\nSOURCE CSI Compressco LP", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/csi-compressco-lp-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604611.html", "http://www.csicompressco.com/"], "published": "2018-02-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T17:34:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
