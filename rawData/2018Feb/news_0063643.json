The Company expects full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.60 to $0.70, and also expects full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high-end of its previously provided range of $2.25 to $2.35, due to a lower expected tax rate associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nTotal revenues for the full year 2017 were $1,188.2 million, an increase of $196.2 million, or 19.8%, over the prior year. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $368.6 million, an increase of $112.9 million, or 44.2%, over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOrganic revenues for the full year 2017, as set forth in the attached reconciliation, increased 4.6% over the prior year, while fourth quarter organic revenues were higher by 5.8% over the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"2017 was a transformative year for Integra. We closed the two largest acquisitions in the Company's history, expanded our regenerative portfolio with new, innovative products and successfully executed the global launch of CUSA ® Clarity, a significant upgrade to our tissue ablation platform,\" said Peter Arduini, Integra's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We look forward to 2018 and another year of strong revenue growth, margin expansion and improving profitability.\"\nThe Company reported GAAP net income of $64.7 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the full year 2017, compared to GAAP net income of $74.6 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in 2016.\nThe Company reported GAAP net income of $44.4 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to GAAP net income of $28.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in the Company recognizing a net income tax benefit of $37.9 million. This includes a $43.4 million benefit from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as a result of the reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, offset by a one-time toll charge of $5.5 million imposed on deemed repatriation of foreign untaxed earnings.\nAdjusted measures discussed below are computed with the adjustments to GAAP reporting set forth in the attached reconciliation.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $269.5 million, an increase of $37.8 million, over the prior year. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue declined from 23.4% in 2016 to 22.7% in 2017, largely resulting from the dilution of the Derma Sciences acquisition and higher sales channel investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $88.7 million, an increase from $66.5 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 24.1%, compared to 26.0% in the prior year period.\nAdjusted net income for the full year 2017 was $153.4 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, compared to $135.3 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $51.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $40.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash flows from operations totaled $114.5 million. Capital expenditures were $43.5 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 46.3% versus 82.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, due to significant one-time cash outlays associated with the acquisition integrations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company generated $11.6 million of cash flows from operations, and incurred capital expenditures of $13.7 million.\nOutlook for 2018\nThe Company is reiterating its full-year 2018 revenue guidance in the range of $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion, and now expects to be at the high end of the range due primarily to more favorable foreign currency rates.\nThe Company expects GAAP earnings per diluted share for the full year to be between $0.60 and $0.70, and adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of its previously provided range of $2.25 to 2.35, due primarily to a lower expected tax rate from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\"Given our strong close to the year, the momentum in our businesses, and the benefit of a lower tax rate, we remain confident that we will deliver 5% organic growth and adjusted earnings per share at the high-end of our range,\" said Glenn Coleman, Chief Financial Officer. \"Consistent with previous guidance, we expect first quarter organic growth to be in the low single-digits as we work through the sales channel integration in both of our segments, which we believe will result in higher organic growth in the second half of 2018.\"\nIn the future, the Company may record, or expects to record, certain additional revenues, gains, expenses or charges as described in the Discussion of Adjusted Financial Measures below that it will exclude in the calculation of organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS for historical periods and in providing adjusted EPS guidance.\nConference Call and Presentation Available Online\nIntegra has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 a.m. ET today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018 to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results, and forward-looking financial guidance.

Organic revenues consist of total revenues excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, acquired revenues and product discontinuances. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income from continuing operations, excluding: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) other income (expense); (iii) interest income and expense; (iv) income taxes; and (v) those operating expenses also excluded from adjusted net income. The measure of adjusted net income consists of GAAP net income from continuing operations, excluding: (i) global enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") implementation charges; (ii) structural optimization charges; (iii) certain employee severance charges; (iv) acquisition-related charges; (v) convertible debt non-cash interest; (vi) intangible asset amortization expense; and (vii) discontinued product lines charges; (viii) income tax impact from adjustments; and (ix) hurricane related expenses and other items. The measure of adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding is calculated by adding the economic benefit of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to Integra's 2016 convertible notes. The adjusted earnings per diluted share measure is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to diluted shares by adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The measure of free cash flow consists of GAAP net cash provided by continuing operating activities from continuing operations less purchases of property and equipment. The adjusted free cash flow conversion measure is calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income.\nReconciliations of GAAP revenues to adjusted revenues and GAAP Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income, and GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share all for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, appear in the financial tables in this release.\nThe Company believes that the presentation of organic revenues and the various adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding why Integra believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this earnings press release filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
