Adjusted Funds from Operations was $35.2 million in the fourth quarter versus $29.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"GNL made significant progress in several key areas,\" commented chief executive officer James Nelson. \"During the fourth quarter 2017, we were successful securing accretive acquisitions that resulted in revenue growth of 26% over the fourth quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, we increased our quarterly funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations as compared to the third quarter 2017.\n\"We're also proud that, in 2017, Global Net Lease demonstrated a clear ability to both access the capital markets on attractive terms through our $130 million in aggregate preferred stock offerings and execute on our plans to transform the composition of the Company's portfolio by adding over $98 million of net new assets. We also continued our disciplined hedging strategy of layering hedges against the British Pound and the Euro over upcoming quarters to manage our exposure to both currencies. These actions, coupled with our ability to close new loans and credit facilities, enhanced our liquidity and capital structure. We exited the year better positioned to build upon these efforts as we entered 2018.\"\nMr. Nelson concluded, \"Looking forward, we project that, with new leadership, a stronger balance sheet and a great start to the year with pending and closed acquisitions of nearly $300 million we have further scaled and diversified our portfolio in an accretive manner. Our focus will remain on increasing our industrial and distribution exposure in the U.S. while maintaining our strong presence in Europe as we build stronger cash flows in order to drive long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nQuarter Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenue\n$\n66,602\n$\n52,773\n$\n259,295\n$\n214,174\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n5,998\n$\n15,946\n$\n20,731\n$\n47,140\nNet income per common share\n$\n0.09\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.30\n$\n0.82\nNAREIT defined FFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n34,553\n$\n28,847\n$\n132,612\n$\n129,085\nNAREIT defined FFO per common share\n$\n0.51\n$\n0.50\n$\n1.98\n$\n2.28\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n34,103\n$\n36,202\n$\n134,635\n$\n138,798\nCore FFO per common share\n$\n0.51\n$\n0.63\n$\n2.01\n$\n2.45\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n35,165\n$\n29,272\n$\n140,652\n$\n127,061\n*All per share data based on 67,286,822 and 66,877,620 weighted average shares outstanding for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the \"White Paper\"). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property but including asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time, especially if not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nCore Funds From Operations\nCore funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") is FFO, excluding acquisition and transaction related costs as well as certain other costs that are considered to be non-core, such as fire loss and other costs related to damages at our properties. The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make dividend payments to stockholders. In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction related costs as well as non-core costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations\nIn calculating adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), we exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other non-cash income and expense items and the income and expense effects of other activities that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan. These items include early extinguishment of debt and unrealized gains and losses, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gains or losses on derivative instruments, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and gains and losses on investments. In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as amortization of above-market and below-market leases intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, straight-line rent and equity-based compensation from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have a direct impact on our ongoing operating performance. We also include the realized gains or losses on foreign currency exchange contracts for AFFO as such items are part of our ongoing operations and affect the current operating performance of the Company. By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that can be used to better assess the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance without the impacts of transactions that are not related to the ongoing profitability of our portfolio of properties. We also believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry. Further, we believe AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies.\nIn calculating AFFO, we exclude certain expenses which under GAAP are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. All paid and accrued merger, acquisition and transaction related fees and certain other expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of our on-going performance. AFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to companies that did not have such activities. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income. In addition, as discussed above, we view gains and losses from fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the Company. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nCaution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures\nFFO, Core FFO, and AFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO, Core FFO and AFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO, Core FFO and AFFO. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition (as we do) or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do or calculate Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do. Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs.\nWe consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance. Because FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our peer group.\nAs a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. However, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Investors are cautioned that FFO, Core FFO and AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as it excludes certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred.\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, and Net Operating Income\nWe believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related expenses, other non- cash items and including our pro-rata share from unconsolidated joint ventures (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating activities. Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other REITs. Net operating income (\"NOI\") is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less discontinued operations, interest, other income and income from preferred equity investments and investment securities, plus corporate general and administrative expense, acquisition and transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-net-lease-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604696.html\nSOURCE Global Net Lease, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.globalnetlease.com/", "http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-net-lease-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604696.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:47:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
