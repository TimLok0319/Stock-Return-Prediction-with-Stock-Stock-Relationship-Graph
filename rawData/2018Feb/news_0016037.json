Iraq now relies on the Doura refinery, in Baghdad, and Shuaiba, in southern Iraq.\nThe Kirkuk project follows the announcement in January of plans for four other refineries to be built in the port of Fao on the Gulf, the southern region of Nasiriya, the western Anbar province and Qayara near the northern city of Mosul.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Dale Hudson and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:53:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
